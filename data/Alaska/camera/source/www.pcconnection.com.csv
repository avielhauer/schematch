This, first and foremost, is a serious camera designed to capture amazing images in almost any situation. It starts with a quality 23mm wide-angle lens that gives you a 21x optical zoom and optical image stabilization. You can go fully automated, fully manual or select a setting (like aperture or shutter priority) and let the camera figure out the rest. With Samsung S Voice, you can also tell your camera what to do. It will respond to commands like “smile, ” “record video” and “zoom in.”
Edit photos & videos quick & easy:
You’ll take beautiful photos and clear, vibrant video with the Galaxy Camera. But it doesn’t stop there. With Photo Wizard, you can edit those photos right in the camera – adjust brightness and color, add effects, crop and more. And with Video Editor, you can delete and rearrange scenes, add music and insert text. These are precision tools that make sure the photos and videos you share are exactly as you like them. And you’ll see every amazing detail on the 4.8” HD Super Clear Touch Screen LCD.
Share easily and beautifully:
The Galaxy Camera is packed with advanced sharing features. But its most basic sharing feature might be its most impressive – simply showing your friends your new photos and videos on the big, beautiful 4.8” HD Super Clear Touch Screen. Then technology – thanks to Android and Wi-Fi – brings sharing to a whole new level. Use Buddy Photo Share to share directly to your favorite social networks, and Share Shot to share with other devices. You’ll also be able to access your photos from any AllShare Play device.
Enjoy photos smarter:
Samsung made enjoying your photos and videos is almost as much fun as capturing them. First of all, SMART Content Manager automatically organizes your photos so you can always find what you’re looking for. You can view your albums by time, location, favorites or more. Second of all, you can watch your videos – or almost any other multimedia content – through the Video Player. Third of all, there’s a Music Player. Fourth of all, the Galaxy Camera gives you a full web browser to enjoy everything else. Plus, Smart Gestures lets you interact with your memories in new, very intuitive ways, like Tilt to Zoom, Pan to Browse and more.",,8 GB,

Do more than ever with the Android-powered GALAXY Camera 2, now upgraded with the latest version of Jelly Bean: 4.3. Powered by a 1.6GHz quad-core processor—and featuring numerous camera and social networking apps—it does what conventional cameras and smartphones cannot. Like capturing brilliant images, even in low-lit settings, and saving photos to your PC and smartphone without having to use an SD card. Plus you can edit right on the display, and wirelessly upload to Facebook and Instagram.
4.8” HD Super Clear Touch Display:
Now you don’t have to wait until you get back home to properly review and edit your photos. The GALAXY Camera 2’s 121.2mm (4.8"") HD Super Clear Touch Display is what a camera display was meant to be, with an ultra sharp 308 pixels per inch and the full spectrum of glorious colors. And with the new White Magic Technology, you can even double the brightness without worrying about battery consumption. And why not view your HD movies at a golden 16:9 ratio- Perfect.
21x Optical Super Long Zoom:
Save the digital zoom for editing afterwards. GALAXY Camera 2’s 21x Super Long Zoom is 100 percent optical. With the intuitive Pinch Zoom, you can zoom in and out by simply pinching two fingers on the screen. Both the 21x Super Long Zoom and Pinch Zoom help get you as close as possible to your subject while maintaining the same crystal-clear image sharpness you experience with subjects nearer to the camera.

Or instantly capture a high-speed scene with Action Freeze. A quick tap of Smart Mode, and you’re set with various special modes. Just choose the one you want and shoot perfection.
Smart Mode Suggest:
Stop worrying about settings, and start taking professional-quality artistic shots. A quick tap of the Smart Mode button gives you access to a wide range of special modes.

Simply tap your SMART CAMERA on any NFC-compatible smartphone to automatically share whichever image you’re currently viewing. It’s that simple.
AutoShare:
Save every photo you take with your smartphone. After you set it up, Samsung AutoShare will automatically send every snap instantly to your smartphone or tablet via Wi-Fi that is powered by NFC technology. Using your smartphone, AutoShare also GPS-tags your photos. Sharing your treasured memories couldn’t be any faster—or easier.

Control your camera by using your smartphone as the viewfinder. The NFC-enabled Remote Viewfinder lets you preview photos, adjust camera settings, zoom in and out, and frame each scene—all from your phone wirelessly. Available for select smartphones, this feature also GPS-tags your photos using your smartphone.
Mobile Link:
Now you can select and send photos or albums directly to a smartphone or tablet with Samsung Mobile Link. No Wi-Fi hotspot is required; the wireless connection is enabled by NFC technology. You don't even have to send the photos as a text message or an email. With Mobile Link, you can control the album on your phone and the changes will be saved to your camera, too.
Group Share:
From family brunches to nights out with friends, you can take the shots that all your friends and family members want copies of with your Samsung SMART CAMERA. Use Group Share to send images to up to four people simultaneously. Since Group Share eliminates the frustration of having to repeat the sharing process over and over again, you have more time for taking share-worthy snaps.

Tag and add comments, too. You can also upload photos right to your blog, or email them to your family. Feel free to keep shooting, because your SMART CAMERA also comes with 2GB of free Dropbox web storage or 50GB if you have a GALAXY smartphone.

No more waiting to go home to manually upload images. With one touch, you can show off photos and videos on your Smart TV or send them to any compatible smartphone. Sharing has never been this easy.
Selfie Alarm:
You are the star of your selfie. So why use a smartphone camera when you can snap a high-resolution 20MP self-portrait with the GALAXY Camera 2 instead- It’s easier than you’d expect, thanks to the Selfie Alarm feature. Simply hold up the camera and face it, and Selfie Alarm automatically shoots five images in a row. Choose your fave of the batch and make it your Facebook profile picture.

This APS-C size sensor creates an effective 1.6x field of view (compared to 35mm format).
ISO 100-12800 and expandable to 25600 in H mode:
Thanks to its DIGIC 5 Image Processor, the EOS Rebel T5i features an expanded ISO range of ISO 100-12800 (expandable to 25600 in H mode) that makes shooting possible in situations previously unthinkable without flash. The EOS Rebel T5i, with the DIGIC 5 Image Processor's remarkable noise-reduction technology, performs brilliantly in low-light shooting. Used with one of Canon's EF or EF-S lenses with Optical Image Stabilizer, the EOS Rebel T5i can record beautiful images even when light sources are scarce.
DIGIC 5 Image Processor:
The EOS Rebel T5i's DIGIC 5 Image Processor works with the camera's CMOS sensor to deliver images with incredible detail in more situations, without the need for artificial light sources. With the power of the DIGIC 5 Image Processor, the EOS Rebel T5i can achieve higher ISO sensitivity, can shoot up to 5.0 fps continuously and can even perform advanced functions like HDR Backlight Control, art filters, lens correction and much more. The camera's brilliant imaging core supercharges every facet of still and moving image capture.
High-speed continuous shooting:
The EOS Rebel T5i can shoot up to 5.0 frames per second, continuously. Thanks to the enhanced shutter mechanism, mirror drive and camera sensor, the EOS Rebel T5i is ready for action; whether capturing that perfect expression, the game's winning goal, or the bride walking down the aisle, the EOS Rebel T5i delivers the speed and performance to guarantee results.
Exceptional autofocus performance and Hybrid CMOS AF:
The EOS Rebel T5i is equipped with AF features that ensure speedy, accurate and continuous AF every time. When shooting through the viewfinder, the EOS Rebel T5i has advanced autofocus with a 9-point, all cross-type AF system (including a high-precision dual-cross f/2.8 center point) for accurate focus whether the camera is oriented in portrait or landscape position. An AI Servo AF system achieves and maintains consistent focus with an exceptional degree of reliability.
The EOS Rebel T5i also features Canon's amazing Hybrid CMOS AF System, perfect for shooting photos and video in Live View. This system combines two distinct AF technologies, phase and contrast detection AF, for speedier and more accurate focus. These complementary focusing systems are aided by pixels on the camera's CMOS sensor that assist in predicting subject location, making continuous focus tracking quick and accurate in video recording while enhancing focusing speed.
EOS Full HD Movie Mode with Movie Servo AF:
The EOS Rebel T5i offers easy-to-use, professional video capture without compromise. It enables easy manual control of exposure, focus and Live View features, even in-camera editing! Movie Servo AF allows continuous autofocus tracking of moving subjects while recording video.

What if you could be anywhere you wished to go? Now you can be there when the winning goal hits the back of the net. Or get a front-row view of the school play—from any seat in the house. The Samsung WB2100 Camera’s 35x optical zoom telephoto lens delivers crisp detail and sharp focus every time, putting you in the middle of the action no matter where it’s happening.
3” Tilt LCD Screen:
See life from a whole new angle and add excitement to your images. The Samsung WB2100 Camera’s 3.0""(75mm) Tilt Display offers a full 135-degree range of motion. So now you can easily frame and capture a low-angle image from the best position—or even hold the camera over a crowd and still see exactly what you’re getting.
Low light Shot:
Show your subject in the best possible light—in moonlight, candlelight, or practically no light at all. Low-Light Shot mode takes three continuous shots, and then merges them all into one clear, bright image with minimal blur or noise.
16MP CMS Sensor:
Trust your equipment and shoot with confidence. The super-fast, super-sensitive 16-megapixel BSI (back side–illuminated) CMOS sensor needs less light for proper exposure and quicker focus than conventional sensors. So even if a moment happens in a heartbeat, or is lit only by the reflected glow of the moon, with the Samsung WB2100 Camera, your photos will be sure to match your memories.
Optical Image Stabilization:
The Samsung WB2100 Camera’s Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) gives your images crisp focus, even if you’re not perfectly still. Shoot with confidence in any condition to experience photos that come out sharp and clear—in low-light situations, when zooming in for a shot, or while you’re on the move.
Panorama Shot:
Don’t be limited to landscapes or group portraits when taking panoramic shots with a wide-angle lens. Simply aim the camera with the shutter pressed fully down and then release when you’re ready to take the shot. Once the shots have been taken, Samsung’s proprietary panoramic technology automatically searches for motion borders of the two images and stitches them together as if a professional had taken the shot.
Full HD Recording with Movie Zoom:
The Samsung WB2100 Camera’s 35x optical wide zoom capability delivers smooth Full HD 1080/60i video and amazing low-light performance. And Movie Zoom automatically adjusts and optimizes sound settings—while eliminating motor “whir”—to give you crystalclear audio performance, too. And with an advanced HDMI interface, the WB2100 is one camera that works hard and plays well with others.
Rich Tone:
Capture the blazing light and subtle depth of a sunset over water. With Rich Tone (HDR), the Samsung WB2100 Camera offers a greater range of luminance, so shadows aren’t too dark and highlights aren’t oversaturated. The result: perfect exposure in all areas, and vibrant details that pop.",,,

Improved noise reduction produces clearer images when shooting in low light at high ISO speeds. The faster processing speed results in faster continuous shooting capability while maintaining full image quality. With the power of the DIGIC 5 Image Processor, the PowerShot S110 can achieve higher ISO sensitivity and even perform advanced functions like lens correction, special scene modes and much more.
The PowerShot S110 gives you the power to create images with spectacular depth, detail and emotional resonance. The 12.1 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor works in concert with Canon's own latest-generation DIGIC 5 Image Processor to create the renowned Canon HS SYSTEM.
