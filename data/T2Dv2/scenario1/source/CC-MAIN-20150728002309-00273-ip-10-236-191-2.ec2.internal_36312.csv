"I YOU beauteous ladies great and small,",
"I write unto you, one and all,",
Whereby that you may understand,
What I have sufferÂd in this land.,
,
"II I was by birth a lady fair,",5
My fatherÂs chief and only heir;,
"But when my good old father died,",
Then I was made a young knightÂs bride.,
,
"III And then my love built me a bower,",
BedeckÂd with many a fragrant flower;,10
A braver bower you neÂer did see,
Than my true love did build for me.,
,
"IV But there came thieves late in the night,",
"They robbÂd my bower, and slew my knight,",
And after that my knight was slain,15
I could no longer there remain.,
,
V My servants all from me did fly,
"In the midst of my extremity,",
And left me by myself alone,
With a heart more cold than any stone.,20
,
"VI Yet, though my heart was full of care,",
Heaven would not suffer me to despair;,
Wherefore in haste I changed my name,
From fair Elise to Sweet William.,
,
"VII And therewithal I cut my hair,",25
And dressÂd myself in manÂs attire;,
"And in my beaver, hose, and band,",
I travellÂd far through many a land.,
,
"VIII With a silver rapier by my side,",
So like a gallant I did ride;,30
"The thing that I delighted on,",
It was to be a serving-man.,
,
IX Thus in my sumptuous manÂs array,
I bravely rode along the way;,
And at the last it chancÃ¨d so,35
That I to the KingÂs court did go.,
,
"X Then to the King I bowÂd full low,",
My love and duty for to show;,
"And so much favour I did crave,",
That I a serving-manÂs place might have.,40
,
"XI ÂStand up, brave youth,Â the King replied,",
ÂThy service shall not be denied;,
But tell me first what thou canst do;,
Thou shalt be fitted thereunto.,
,
"XII ÂWilt thou be usher of my hall,",45
To wait upon my nobles all?,
"Or wilt thou be taster of my wine,",
To wait on me when I do dine?,
,
"XIII ÂOr wilt thou be my chamberlain,",
To make my bed both soft and fine?,50
Or wilt thou be one of my guard?,
And I will give thee thy reward.Â,
,
"XIV Sweet William, with a smiling face,",
"Said to the King, ÂIfÂt please your Grace",
"To show such favour unto me,",55
Your chamberlain I fain would be.Â,
,
"XV The King then did the nobles call,",
To ask the counsel of them all;,
Who gave consent Sweet William he,
The KingÂs own chamberlain should be.,60
,
XVI Now mark what strange thing came to pass:,
"As the King one day a-hunting was,",
"With all his lords and noble train,",
Sweet William did at home remain.,
,
XVII Sweet William had no company then,65
"With him at home, but an old man:",
"And when he saw the house was clear,",
He took a lute which he had there:,
,
"XVIII Upon the lute Sweet William playÂd,",
"And to the same he sang and said,",70
With a sweet and noble voice,
Which made the old man to rejoice:,
,
XIX ÂMy father was as brave a lord,
"As ever Europe did afford,",
"My mother was a lady bright,",75
My husband was a valiant knight:,
,
"XX ÂAnd I myself a lady gay,",
BedeckÂd with gorgeous rich array;,
The bravest lady in the land,
Had not more pleasure at command.,80
,
"XXI ÂI had my music every day,",
Harmonious lessons for to play;,
I had my virgins fair and free,
Continually to wait on me.,
,
"XXII ÂBut now, alas! my husbandÂs dead,",85
And all my friends are from me fled;,
"My former joys are passÂd and gone,",
For I am now a serving-man.Â,
,
"XXIII At last the King from hunting came,",
"And presently, upon the same,",90
"He callÃ¨d for this good old man,",
And thus to speak the King began:,
,
"XXIV ÂWhat news, what news, old man?Â quoth he;",
ÂWhat news hast thou to tell to me?ÂÂ,
"ÂBrave news,Â the old man he did say,",95
ÂSweet William is a lady gay.ÂÂ,
,
"XXV ÂIf this be true thou tellÂst to me,",
IÂll make thee lord of high degree;,
"But if thy words do prove a lie,",
Thou shalt be hangÂd up presently.Â,100
,
"XXVI But when the King the truth had found,",
His joys did more and more abound:,
"According as the old man did say,",
Sweet William was a lady gay.,
,
XXVII Therefore the King without delay,105
"Put on her glorious rich array,",
And upon her head a crown of gold,
Which was most famous to behold.,
,
"XXVIII And then, for fear of further strife,",
He took Sweet William for his wife:,110
"The like before was never seen,",
A serving-man to be a queen.,
