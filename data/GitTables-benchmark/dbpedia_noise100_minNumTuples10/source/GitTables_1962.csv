Adding the safeguard doesn&#x27;t mean effort won&#x27;t be put into fixing the actual bugs.  But you just don&#x27;t fix all the world&#x27;s bugs overnight.

Considering that Dart is open source, standardized by the same international body as JavaScript (ECMA), and compiles to JavaScript I think the argument against it would be weightier if it was made on technical merits.<p>But I agree that it would be dangerous for one company to control the web - but like you said it&#x27;s a pipe dream that Dart will gain wider adoption - so why worry yourself by writing all that about it? <i>You can&#x27;t say it will never gain wider adoption and then also be worried about it gaining wider adoption at the same time.</i> So either it has merit and will gain adoption and we should be worried about it, or it doesn&#x27;t have merit and there&#x27;s nothing to worry about.",1410084423

The problem is aesthetic[1]. Some letterforms are inherently unbalanced and create tension, notably the wild angles in the m, the serif in the s, and the tipping-over T. The wobbles in the I, n, and h distract as well. Beyond that, there are the subtler issues of different inclination on the verticals (j, t, l, h) and bad kerning for various character pairs.<p>If Comic Sans were truly convincing as handwritten font, it would probably be better; on the plus side it is sufficiently far from that that it avoids falling in the very bottom of a handwriting uncanny valley.<p>Now aesthetics doesn&#x27;t necessarily impede legibility per se, but beauty and visual harmony are generally enjoyable, and  use of Comic Sans eschews it. Compare it to the much better Comic Neue[2].<p>[1] example: <a href=""http://kinkeaddesigns.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Comic-Sans-Probs.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kinkeaddesigns.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Comic-S...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://comicneue.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://comicneue.com/</a>",1410084334

But I suspect that Swift may have dependencies on new or recent Foundation features which could be missing from the open-source versions (for understandable reasons, they lag behind Apple by several years).",1410084118
