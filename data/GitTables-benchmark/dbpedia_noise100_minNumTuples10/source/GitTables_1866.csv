In the unlikely event he is able to make something happen with the product, you're entitled to 30% of the profit, but I wouldn't count on it.  In this option, you do not keep a copy of the code for yourself, or do anything with it in the future.<p>Option #2 is to have a long, hard talk with him.  Lay everything out on the table, as clearly as possible.  Explain that you have developed a product that you think is ready to ship, and that you don't want to do any more work until it does ship.  If he has a list of things he things are necessary to get in the product before the initial ship date, have him itemize the list in detail, and then discuss and agree (in writing) on each one.<p>Option #3 is to buy your ""partner"" out.  Ask him to assign all rights to the product to you, in exchange for some consideration you both agree on (cash, or a share of the profits.)  Needless to say, you need to get the agreement in writing this time.<p>Option #4 is to talk to a lawyer.  I'm not a lawyer, but I would be absolutely shocked if you have any direct rights to the source code.  I believe you'd be exposing yourself to potential legal action if you tried to release this code, or do anything else with it on your own.  You really don't want to go down that road.",1302692353

He was looking to make an iPad app. I agreed to a 30% stake... not sure why, in retrospect. He said he had lots of connections, and corporate relationships could be helpful in this app's market. I don't negotiate on my feet very well ;-)<p>I flew out to meet him in person. He had a very loose concept, so I drafted a concrete design while he gawked. I outlined a 3 week release target, he agreed to it, and I went to work hacking.<p>I completed a clean, high quality very-release-able app in 4 weeks, well exceeding the very basic features/specs I outlined for the 3-week-initial-release. He argues with me about inane points, I agree to some changes I know are bad ideas to appease him.<p>Cue to 3 mos later.<p>He still won't let me release, keeps promising he'll agree to a release if only I do X or Y - most X or Ys are very bad ideas, slimey, or even plain infeasible 'designs' that don't understand how to do a workable UI on a tiny touchscreen... you know the sort.<p>Also, he is driving me crazy, drags me through inane powerpoint slides and meetings, plays a lot of buzzword bingo, and hasn't contributed /anything/ to the company by my reckoning.<p>I quit my day job to work on this, but would have quit anyway. I know: I'm a fool. But its relevant because no-job means I'm also not wanting to lawyer up and spend the $. I'd just walk away if it came to that.<p>Clearly, this 'partnership' cannot continue, but I've sunk 3 mos into it, and produced a handsome iPad app, and even half an android version. I want to release them.<p>I feel like he is holding me hostage using my own work.<p>So the question: afaict I'm an independent contractor, and by most interpretations the sole author of the source code.<p>He's written me a few hundred dollar check for the flight (deal was: I travel, he pays), but I haven't signed (or verbally agreed) to assign copyright.<p>Should I just walk away? Or should I send him a message that I'm not doing this as a partnership anymore and I'm going to release on my own? Or something else???<p>I'd be happy to give him a copy of the source code too if he wants to continue it in his imo crazy direction.<p>thanks all. good to vent if nothing else.",1302691519

And it likely won't get picked up on because I'm too low on the totem pole.<p>I joined a forum a few years ago at a time when I was very ill, doped to the gills and had major trouble ""behaving"" myself, so not at my best.  It had been around for a few years and the owner whined constantly that he wanted to increase membership, especially international membership, and couldn't figure out how.  I was there six months and membership began going up dramatically, especially international membership -- so much so that they eventually created some subforums aimed at the international members. But I don't think anyone really knew it was me that engineered it.  I wasn't even a moderator at the time.  You don't have to be a moderator to treat other people well.  In fact, it probably helps in some ways if you aren't a moderator because then it is simply an example of a decent human being, not a person with a duty to set the example.<p>More recently, I joined a forum with 300 members and almost no discussion.  After I joined, people began talking to each other.  Last I checked, it had 1800 members and has probably become the Go To place for its niche, likely displacing a more long-standing group for that niche.  Why? In part because I got thrown out of the long-standing place.  The fact is that in some ways, where I am, that's where the action is.  Except I'm not a hacker.  I don't expect to be all that influential on HN.  I come here because I get to be treated like a normal human being and people, oh, talk to me instead of dividing up between those that worship me like a rock star and those that desperately want to shoot me down and put me in my place.  So I am content with being a Nobody on HN and I have diabolical plans to remain a Noboby on HN so that it can remain a decent social outlet for me instead becoming ruined for me socially like every place where I ever became Somebody and then after fostering discussion generally on the forum, I was the only person no one would really talk to.<p>Still, I'm compulsively helpful, I tend to care, I have this unusual expertise (or insight or some such) and it just annoys the crap out of me when I can't give it away.  Maybe some day I will come to my senses and stop caring about others and just use it the way most socially insightful people seem to use their skills:  As manipulative ass-hats, for personal gain, because they know something others don't know.

But yes, perhaps it would show a nice contrast to batching if graphed along with it.<p>2) This is an interesting question. I think it depends on how a non-batching solution is implemented: A) if each client obtains its own file handle, fsync()s can theoretically be issued 'slightly more concurrently'; B) if a unique file handle is the only one upon which fsync()s are called, this is essentially my solution with a dedicated thread, but which only writes one update at a time.<p>For A I'd guess a client would have to wait less for not-very concurrent environments, while in B wait time grows longer for ""unlucky"" concurrent threads.

A portion of your happiness at work is down to the quality of people you work with, no?

Look at the story again: the kid made out better than anyone because his $175/hr is his for as many hours as he works no matter how the company performs that year.
