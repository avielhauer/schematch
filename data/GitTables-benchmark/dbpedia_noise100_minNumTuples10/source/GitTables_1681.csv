Visual basic 6 is my first programming language and is probably still my favourite. The problem with lua and python and most other &quot;beginner friendly&quot; languages is that it is hard to do anything useful when u are just starting other than printing hello world to terminal. My intro to vb6 was creating a simple calculator, it was amazing knowing that i could create an application simply by dragging and dropping some elements and writing some code. I never had to worry about things like gtk bindings and makefiles etc. The earlier version of visual studio started up in less then a second and I never experienced any lag. The killer feature was probably the combination of both an just-in-time interpretator and a full-blown compiler. I could simply click play and the app would run, if i need an exe, it would also export one. This feature put most modern &quot;repl-based languages&quot; and &quot;test-driven development&quot; to shame. A lot of people complain that vb 6 is not object-orientated enough, but remember, C is not object-orientated either, and it still tops the tiobe programming list. Windows is sorely in need of an Rapid application development framework. Although vb6 still installs on windows 7, a lot of its features are broken. I really miss having an IDE that doesnt get in your way, starts up quickly, and allows you to get things done fast. The argument that vb6 encourages bad programming practices etc. is not really that valid when the user is not an professional programmer. After all, would you rather teach your kids to code by teaching him about build tools and commandlines and gui bindings or would you simply give them an environment where they can create whatever they want in a fuss-free way?

The developer go where users and money are. And users not necessarily go to devices which have lot of apps. This might sound like a chicken and egg problem, but look at amazon, if developers are writing software for its devices, Amazon is bootstrapping its devices with software. I take out the other devices, the desktop and servers, might not have as much impact as it may sound.<p>Second, Xbox, Bing, may sound looser, but they may be interesting in the next round of battle. The smart phone battle is more or less is over and it is not going to make much difference, but the future of the smart device fields will be another story, if only MS can concentrate on the future in coherent way.",1413029573

The question raised in the article is basically, &quot;Is human consciousness special?&quot;<p>When Copernicus questioned the Earth&#x27;s special place at the center of the Universe, it upset people immensely. Similarly, Darwin&#x27;s ideas upset massive numbers of people to this day by suggesting that we are the product of relatively mundane forces. Human beings naturally tend to believe that they are special and that mere mechanisms cannot match their extraordinary attributes.<p>It&#x27;s clearly upsetting to people to suggest that people are not &quot;conscious,&quot; but in fact the spirit of the question is useful and sobering. &quot;Consciousness&quot; and &quot;awareness&quot; are loaded terms, often tinged with connotations bordering on mysticism. &quot;Attention&quot; is generally a more mundane word. We have no qualms recognizing engineered attention systems, while most would balk at describing them as &quot;self-aware&quot;, or &quot;conscious.&quot; If we define consciousness as a system with reflexive attention, then human are conscious but so are certain computer systems. What&#x27;s in dispute is the quasi-mystical, highly anthropomorphic conception of consciousness, by whatever name, verses a more mundane and objective notion of sensing and modeling external and internal events.",1413029447

The underlying factors won&#x27;t change unless a large percentage of vehicles are self-driving.
