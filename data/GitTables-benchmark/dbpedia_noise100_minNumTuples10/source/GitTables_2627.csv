Otherwise, lecture is boring and definitely not helpful. Your TA is most helpful, and all the quizzes in TA section, at least this semester, is all multiple choice. Overall, it isn't really difficult material.",11/21/2005,2,2.0,,3,Sorta interested,2.5,2.5,1,,,1112,,,,,people,people

Not only that, but one of the 16 essays on the midterm counted for half the exam. He isn't very fair, and I think you would get more out of engaging with the book rather than going to lecture. what a waste",11/09/2005,3,3.0,,3,Really into it,2.0,2.0,1,,,1112,,,,,people,people
