"Syria: Qatar is the main supporter of the initialpeaceful protestsagainst PresidentBashar al-Assad, alongsideTurkey. In 2012, Saudi Arabia involves itself in the resultingcivil waras Qatari and Turkish influence grows among the rebels and Assadbecomes more dependant on Iran. The KSA and Qatar back rival rebels, benefitting the Assad axis and what in 2014 becomes theIslamic State.

Saleh is ousted in theYemeni Revolutionin 2012, but reemerges to support the 2014-2015Houthi takeover in Yemen. Qatar supports the 2015Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemenagainst theHouthisand Saleh, but is forced by the KSA to withdraw from the conflict in 2017."
