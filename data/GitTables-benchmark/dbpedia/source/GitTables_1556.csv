At least it is me who does not like it, but I guess the others think similar. We want a community driven logging project which uses the Apache License. We surely don't want a logging project which is officially run by a company (like QOS runs logback). I have seen many cases where this does lead into problems.<p>That said it will be difficult to motivate Ceki to get back to Apache Logging. But we are open to his contributions and hope that there will be a good, technical exchange between both projects.<p>Another personal note: I am really against person cult. The Apache Logging project has some really great and experienced committers on board. One of them is working on Java logging for around 20 years and he set a very, very high bar for log4j.

If no-one is prepared to pay for your content then the market rate for your content is, by definition, zero.  We pay in two ways - direct purchasing, and delivering surplus attention beyond that required to consume the media, which can be redirected towards various forms of advertising.  When you cannot run your business on advertising revenue alone it means that not enough people are giving enough surplus attention of enough value to cover.<p>This argument about the ""inherent value"" of one form of content or another - of the need to pay artists or creators, or in this case journalists - doesn't extend to other realms.  If I decide I want to be a carpenter, I cannot build a table and demand someone buy that table for $1,000.  If the market won't bear that price for the table then the government isn't going to force others to pay me $1,000 because I feel that's what it's ""worth"".<p>The market rates for all forms of media have plummeted due to there being more supply of attention-draining media than there is demand either in terms of hard-dollars in direct payment, or surplus attention to be redirected towards paid advertising (and its ilk).<p>When old media companies had a stranglehold on distribution because paper production and distribution was expensive, or video production costs were prohibitive, only a small elite were able to publish their opinions, and the monopolistic distributors were able to charge a premium for the limited access to information or entertainment they provided.  They weren't paid well because they provided an outstanding product (though it often was), they were paid well because they limited supply.  Those limits are gone.  Many many people produce entertainment and informational content.  Many do it just for fun and are happy not to get paid.  Many more do it with the hope of getting paid anything without the expectation of the lavish salaries and expense accounts of journalists of old.<p>This undercuts their economics and doesn't even touch on the fact that the newer voices often offer media that is more attractive to younger audiences.  Not to mention declining quality of the product in many cases.  Many media companies as they've become bloated monstrosities have undermined their own product quality with short-term-profit-focused decision making which had long term harm.<p>Is it really the case that piracy accounts for all problems in a record industry where the giants spent the pre-Internet-boom '90s crushing independent labels, monopolizing market channels and creating a modern-day payola system on radio where programming was rigidly sliced and diced to the lowest common denominator?  Is none of the loss of popularity of the New York Times down to their abandoning their predominantly liberal subscriber audience during the Bush years and being guilty of mis-leading story after mis-leading story in the build up to the Iraq War, destroying people's confidence in their role as a reliable neutral arbiter?<p>tl;dr The publishers referenced by the OP aren't happy at the market rate for their product and services and want government to rig the market to pay them a cushy wage.  Such subsidies rarely save industries in the long term, and the public should be outraged - because legislation of this sort is a public subsidy on a privileged elite in no uncertain terms.",1354876912

It's not harming me in any way, like it's not also harmful if they drink a bottle of beer on their way home in the subway, which is totally accepted also.<p>To claim that second-hand smoke is not harmful is utterly absurd. The same goes for alcohol consumption in public places. It's fine to have a drink on the subway, but who takes care of the shattered glass the following day[0]? If you're lucky, the local government will use ratepayer money to clean it up. If you're not lucky, it stays there indefinitely.<p>Frankly, I think that those who drink or smoke in public are being totally inconsiderate of others.<p>[0]: This wouldn't be such a big deal if glass bottles weren't so popular.
