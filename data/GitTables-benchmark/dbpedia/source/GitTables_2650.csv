ucentric,17,"We are starting the Personal Information Revolution.<p>We started by giving users a way of owning and being in control of their online identity. We chose valid domain names (enhanced with some simple software and an open public resource schema) as our unique identifiers.<p>We call this Open NetID.<p>Then we combined this with a open source personal communications hub that enables people to control the storage and sharing of their information with others. Using a single identifier, their NetID, they can now share their content with others and vica-versa.<p>We call this a HubSite.<p>Finally we made it available for download to self-host on virtually any PC.<p>We call this a Ucentric internet.<p>That is what we are all about.",1282884128,1452889988
