9085508,comment,9084617.0,9085128.0,0,0,yourapostasy,,,"Please clarify your assertion. Are you saying real estate price <i>increases</i> have contributed 5% of employee costs, or (and this is what everyone else so far reacting to your assertion is interpreting) are you saying residential real estate is 5% of employee compensation costs? Increases in SF and SV area alone over the past 10 years, I can easily buy the 5% figure; could be even smaller. But see my comment further below on the where the bar is for companies to make major changes to capture small payroll savings.<p>If you are describing an increase as a contributory factor, then you are obviously missing the time period that goes along with that increase you are talking about, so readers can go and look up the historical real estate pricing data.<p>At 6-figure high-competency-developer total compensation package (and salary) levels in the US, you are looking at the 28% marginal tax bracket for the employee. High-wage employees like these developers will typically pencil out to 100-150% fully burdened to the company. For top 20 metro areas in the US, you will tend to see most such employees spend closer to 45-50% of gross pre-tax income on shelter costs (counting PITI plus maintenance), rather than the 33% that is the historical prudent personal financial planning guideline (and those guidelines should be taken with a grain of salt for reasons I won&#x27;t get into here).<p>With my CFO hat on, I look at the ratio of third-highest decile (with 50% pinned to the median) of PITI plus maintenance in the parts of the city I anticipate most such employees would prefer to live, to the total burdened cost per developer, to establish just how much the company is paying for shelter costs of its employees. It&#x27;s a surprisingly large percentage for the top 10 metro areas, though everyone&#x27;s specific numbers will be different based upon neighborhoods they choose, time period, etc. The ratio of course goes up as you travel down the skill (and payroll cost) ladder.<p>Even with highly-compensated and -skilled employees towards the higher end of the skill ladder, I was coming up with ratios closer to 10% than 5%. I&#x27;ve seen companies move mountains to capture far, far smaller payroll savings percentages.<p>What is much more difficult to quantify however, are the soft benefits of ready access to the large, concentrated ecosystem that grew up around the industry in that geographic area. Clearly, many companies today consider those soft benefits worth the incurred hard total compensation package costs. It&#x27;s a calculation that you and your advisors should make and continually revisit once in awhile for your venture&#x27;s own individual circumstances.<p>For some smaller outfits who already have an assembled team and are in their early development stage, it is arguable that those soft benefits do not outweigh the immediate cash flow benefits of avoiding the high cost of living areas.",1424526846

9085436,comment,9080896.0,9085011.0,0,0,ekidd,,,"progman posted some useful monad links, and I should know better than to write Yet Another Monad Explanation in a comment. But since you&#x27;re coming from a C++ background, I can maybe fine-tune this to you personally. If it doesn&#x27;t make sense, look somewhere else. :-)<p>First: There are actually two questions hiding here: (1) why are monads interesting in general, and (2) why does Haskell use monads to represent side effects? I&#x27;m going to mostly focus on (1) first, because that helped me more. Other people may strongly prefer starting from (2). My explanation will work best for people who like to make a <i>model</i>; explanations that start with (2) will work best for people who like to start with practical examples.<p>First, let&#x27;s start with a C++ template:<p><pre><code>    template <typename T> List { ... }\n</code></pre>\nHere, we have a list which can contain values of type T. So List<string> is a list of strings, and List<int> is a list of integers. Now, any Lisp or Ruby hacker would tell you that lists are better with a &#x27;map&#x27; function. &#x27;map&#x27; is a function which takes a list and a <i>transformation</i> function, and builds a new list by applying the transformation to every element of the old list. This way, if you have a list of strings, and a function &#x27;convert_string_to_integer&#x27;, you can write:<p><pre><code>    List<int> new_list = list_of_strings.map(convert_string_to_integer);\n</code></pre>\n...and you&#x27;ve got a list of converted integers. If you understand this, you&#x27;re over half of the way to monads!<p>To get a monad, we need to add two more things. First, we need a way to create a new list out of a single element:<p><pre><code>    List<int> new_list = List::from_element(3); // Creates the list { 3 }\n</code></pre>\nAnd then we need the interesting bit. Imagine that we have a list of lists of integers, of type List<List<int>>:<p><pre><code>    { { 1, 2, 3 }, {}, { 4 }, { 5, 6 } }\n</code></pre>\nWe want to flatten this into a single List<int> by smooshing all the lists together:<p><pre><code>    { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 }\n</code></pre>\nThis function might be called &#x27;join&#x27; or &#x27;flatten&#x27; or (in Haskell), you might combine &#x27;map&#x27; and &#x27;join&#x27; into a &quot;map a function then join the result&quot; function called &#x27;bind&#x27;.<p>A <i>monad</i> is basically any templated type that supports &#x27;map&#x27; and &#x27;from_elem&#x27; and &#x27;flatten&#x27;. (There are a few common sense restrictions about how these functions related to each other, too.)<p>Lots and <i>lots</i> of interesting types either fit this model well, or can be smooshed into fitting. This model covers Python&#x27;s list comprehensions, and JavaScript&#x27;s promises, and Rust&#x27;s Option type, and 90+% of collection types, and many much weirder and cooler things.<p>...and this brings us to I/O and Haskell. And here&#x27;s where my explanation won&#x27;t go far enough, but it might &quot;click&quot; for you latter on. In Haskell, conceptually speaking, you don&#x27;t really perform I/O. Instead, you construct instances of &quot;IO a&quot;, which is equivalent to the hypothetical C++:<p><pre><code>    template <typename T> IoAction { ... }\n</code></pre>\n...where <i>IoAction</i> does some I/O and returns a value of type T. Then once you&#x27;ve described an I/O action, you ask Haskell to perform it. The type I/O action supports all our monad functions: If you have an IoAction<string>, it&#x27;s easy to turn it into an IoAction<int> by running the original I/O action and applying a function to the output. Similarly, you can define IoAction::from_elem to (1) do no actual I/O, and (2) just return the elem you gave it. And if somebody gives you an IoAction<IoAction<string>> (an IoAction that returns another IoAction), you can &quot;flatten&quot; it by running the outer IoAction, taking the IoAction it returns, and running that.<p>So if you have an action &#x27;chooseFileName&#x27; of type IoAction<string> and function &#x27;readFile&#x27;  which takes a string as an argument and returns an IoAction<string> that reads in the specified file, you could write:<p><pre><code>    chooseFileName.map(readFile)\n</code></pre>\n...and get an IoAction<IoAction<string>>, and if you flatten it:<p><pre><code>    chooseFileName.map(readFile).flatten()\n</code></pre>\n...you get a new IoAction<string> that prompts for a filename and reads a file. Or you could write:<p><pre><code>    IoAction::from_elem(&quot;my_file.txt&quot;).map(readFile).flatten()\n</code></pre>\n...and get an IoAction<string> that returns whatever is in &quot;my_file.txt&quot;. And this is how Haskell I/O works. But you&#x27;ll probably have to play with it for a while until all the pieces fit together; Haskell is mathy that way.",1424524758

9085417,comment,9080896.0,9085011.0,0,0,chriswarbo,,,"> I do not exactly have a strong math background<p>I&#x27;ve certainly learned more Maths as a result of learning Haskell, but I don&#x27;t think the amount of Maths is vastly more than other languagues; or rather, other languages <i>hide</i> the Maths, either on purpose or by accident.<p>For example, Haskell uses terms like &quot;Monad&quot;, &quot;Monoid&quot;, &quot;Functor&quot;, etc. which <i>are</i> Mathematical ideas, but as far as the language is concerned they&#x27;re just interfaces (APIs). OO APIs can get just as gnarly, so if someone&#x27;s comfortable with design patterns like inversion-of-control containers, dependency-injection mocking frameworks, factory factories, etc. then functional programming ideas are &quot;different&quot; but not necessarily &quot;harder&quot;. Like all fields, there&#x27;s a progression of ideas from simplistic, to powerful, to brain-bending, which everyone can scale at their own pace.<p>> ...the real problem for me seems to be monads. Without having /some/ kind of side effects, you cannot write an even remotely useful program, and I never really got them.<p>Whilst that&#x27;s technically true, all it takes is <i>one</i> side-effect to have a useful program. It&#x27;s perfectly acceptable to ignore monads and side-effects in all of your code, then write a simple &quot;main&quot; definition which plugs them together. In fact, that&#x27;s the <i>encouraged</i> way of programming in Haskell! If you&#x27;re playing around in a commandline, like GHCi, then you don&#x27;t even need a &quot;main&quot; function at all.<p>If you&#x27;re really struggling, you can often copy/paste a &quot;main&quot; which works for you. A trivial one is &quot;print foo&quot;, but even in more realistic examples it&#x27;s possible. To read and write over stdio, you can write the whole thing with pure functions, treat your argument as stdin and your return value as stdout, then do:<p><pre><code>    main = interact myFunction\n</code></pre>\nThe only time monads are actually <i>required</i> is when you need to choose between different side-effects, depending on the result of a previous side-effect. For example, if you write to a file, and the filename depends on the contents of another file:<p><pre><code>    main = do name <- readFile &quot;I_CONTAIN_THE_NAME&quot;\n              writeFile name myString\n</code></pre>\nWhen side-effects don&#x27;t depend on each other, you can use simpler alternatives to Monad, eg. Applicative:<p><pre><code>    main = writeFile &quot;file1&quot; string1 >> writeFile &quot;file2&quot; string2 >> writeFile &quot;file3&quot; string3\n</code></pre>\nFunctor:<p><pre><code>    main = fmap (const ()) (system &quot;rm file1&quot;)\n</code></pre>\nOr, when you only need one side-effect, you don&#x27;t need any of those interfaces at all:<p><pre><code>    main = print &quot;Hello world&quot;\n</code></pre>\n> I have a feeling that an idiomatic Haskell program would make far heavier use of the type system to model your problem than even extreme examples of object-oriented design<p>The way I see it, if you&#x27;re learning Haskell and you&#x27;re tempted to throw an exception, you&#x27;re probably using the wrong type. Exceptions can be useful, and there are advanced Haskell users who make regular use of them, but nowhere near the extent that they&#x27;re used outside Haskell. Many &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot; simply never arise if you use stronger types.",1424523889
