To do that I try and cut up my work into the right size chunks, have a plan, and leave work with an ""easy win"" so I can get back into the loop again quickly.<p>Some examples. Hopefully I'm not descending too far into life-hacker wankery here ;-)<p>* I TDD code, and always try and leave myself with a failing test. If I'm interrupted and don't have a failing test I will deliberately break something or hit undo enough times to get a fail so I have an easy win when I get back.<p>* I don't track time on task. I do block out time for tasks - and track non-relevant interruptions during that time and see if there are ways to stop 'em happening.<p>* I run a personal kanban board for stuff so I can keep that continual ping of reward happening during the day.<p>* I breakdown tasks as they come in so they I can get little reward pings on a regular basis.<p>* When I have real problems getting into flow I give myself automatic rewards (do 20m on X then you can do 5m of fun on Y).

The reason for that continued decline, according to Gartner, is that consumers are increasingly using tablets to do the things they might have done with a PC even a year or two ago.""<p>Sorry, but no. If I take a look at my collegues, friends and family all of them are still using desktop computers (The majority PC's, but some macs) and the main reason they dont buy new PC's as often these days is because they just dont have to. The computer they bought three or four years ago still has enough horsepower to drive most new games at decent settings, and none of them have any problems driving the newest enterprise software.<p>The reason such old computers are still powerful enough is two-fold:\n1. Innovation is slowing down. The processing power of a computer does not increase as fast as it used to. New software isnt as demanding of the current generation of hardware as it was a few years back. Simply put: Hardware has no reason to push the envelope anymore to the same degree as before. Software for regular folk just does not need more horsepower for now.<p>2. Consoles. Of the few software areas that has traditionally pushed PC hardware development it was computer games. The newest game used to be an awesome thing. You had a new-ish computer couldnt keep up with the newest and greatest. Only some could afford to upgrade their rigs enough to run the newest games at max resolution and settings. Consoles that compete with PC's effectively put a roof on that. Games being developed today nearly always are developed for release on the PC and a console. As the current generation of consoles is a few years old it is easy to see which hardware is the limiting factor. This means that even with med-budget computer hardware today you can take the latest and greatest game and play it at maximum settings without breaking a sweat because the game is primarily developed with the inferior console hardware in mind.<p>So simply put, PC sales are not dwindling because of the tablet. It is dwindling because the pressure to upgrade just is not there anymore.",1359718886

The reason why she wanted to accept a student who is Canadian citizen is that many fellowship or grants are only given to Canadian citizens doing research in Canada. What I am saying here is that if your citizenship affects your chance of acceptance, it will be due to funding issues like this. But if the school you are applying is private school, it may not be a problem because they don't receive a lot of private funding I believe.\nI think when it comes down accepting graduate students, your potential supervisor's decision is the most important. I don't know about every program and every school. But in my school, when a professor accepts a student, he/she will sign a form saying that he/she will provide this student financially for at least five years. Therefore, standing from the professor's point of view, he/she really wants to accept a very smart student who can help him/her make great progress in the research and at the same time, receive enough funding to be able to support him/herself.

Myself and the others might not just know racket well enough yet, but it's easy for one person to write unreadable code without ever leaving standard language constructs.<p>But this is also the best thing about racket - the language is flexible enough that you can find a natural way to express whatever you need to.

It is a great place to live, plenty of good people to recruit, a decent domestic market, e.g. many big companies willing to try out services from startups. There is a vast number of small tech companies here, most of them completely unknown. Every week I learn about some cool new company doing their thing just around the block from us, without ever having heard of the people involved.<p>There are some major caveats: Income taxes are extremely high and tax rules makes it almost impossible to share ownership in a rational way, e.g. it is very hard to setup stock option programs etc. Also, the domestic venture capital market is extremely underdeveloped - a great opportunity for foreign investors!<p>I am a firm opponent of all government programs to stimulate entrepreneurship. My view is that the government should simply get out of the way. And in fact, except for the taxes, this is by and large what the Swedish government is doing. For example, there is very little bureaucracy around running a business, e.g. starting an incorporated company is now done easily over the internet, often the whole process can be completed in a matter of days.",1359716473

People seem to be missing two very important things regarding him.<p>Warren Buffett is giving his wealth away, but he isn't doing much actual charitable giving of his own direction. If you read up on it, you'll find that Buffett regards the best use of his time to be capital allocation, aka running Berkshire to generate profit. And then giving that wealth generation to the Gates Foundation to distribute. Why? In Buffett's own words, he thinks he would suck at distribution, so he picked someone better to do it.<p>Buffett is regarded as an important philanthropist now. However, he had no intention of being that during his lifetime. Susan was supposed to give his wealth away, but she (unexpectedly) died before him, forcing Buffett to change course. I assume I don't need to elaborate the point that things are not so linear as so many here seem to think.<p>Has anybody considered that Jobs regarded his best gift as building products? And that his wife would be far better at giving the wealth away.<p>Jobs died at a mere 56 years of age. He was sick for seven years with a form of cancer that is particularly hard to cure. If we're talking about his fortune, in all likelihood his best use of time was to drive Apple forward (he held something like $2 billion worth of Apple stock), and complete the sale of Pixar to Disney (2006) to secure his billions there as well.<p>Was Jobs going to suddenly become an amazing philanthropist, while dying from a horrific cancer, while running Apple and Pixar? This is an absurd notion. Bill Gates - by all accounts a highly productive person - had to leave his work at Microsoft in order to become a good philanthropist and go full time at the Gates Foundation.<p>Gates will spend the rest of his life on the philanthropy course. There was no 'rest of his life' for Jobs, his wife will fulfill that end. His wife will be the great philanthropist. And I believe it's very likely that was exactly what he had in mind. That thought is amplified by his lack of affection for wealth, there's no reason to think Jobs was desperate to hold onto it so he could buy mansions and leave his children billions. The logical conclusion is, he didn't view himself as the one to do the giving. Laurene is a mere 48 years old, she has a long life of giving ahead of her, bet on it.",1359716407
