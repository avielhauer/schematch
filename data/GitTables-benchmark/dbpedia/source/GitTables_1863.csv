My base expenses are less than $500 / month in the Philippines.<p>10,000 furnished apartment.\n~5,000 food\n~2,500 visa\n~1,300 internet\n~1,200 electricity<p>Total: 20,000 / 47.5 = $421<p>I'm probably forgetting some things.  There are misc expenses which would bring me up to the $500.<p>That's not to say I actually live here for that though.  Those are my actual expenses and I can get by with just those but I choose to have a little more fun.  Beer is really cheap here but it adds up if you go out a lot.  A 1/4 lb McD's meal is 135 pesos, so your expenses go up if you eat out a lot.<p>You can nearly cut that rent fee in half if you go for an unfurnished apartment but you have to pay more initially to put in your own furnishing.<p>You won't be traveling on a budget that low but you have to leave the country once every 16 months (I think) for a visa run if you are on a tourist visa.<p>Another big one is taxes.  So if you are running your own business then you have to make $500 / month after taxes.<p>I would say that $750 is a pretty decent figure for a single person not living high on the hog.  As the article mentions, for $4,000 / month you can live like a king.<p>Anything I'm forgetting?<p>ETA:  This is for Dumaguete in the Philippines.  Cebu is more expensive and Manila is more expensive than Cebu.<p>ETA2:  I didn't add local travel expenses because if you stay in Dumaguete for a decent amount of time you might as well buy a motorcycle for around PHP 40,000.  Gas is cheap because you don't use much.  Dumaguete has banned taxis so your only option is a trike which typically costs a total of PHP 60 to go downtown and back.",1245134643

That would suit me just fine.  Once economy of scale starts working with the battery tech, this will work out better economically for a large fraction of consumers.<p>Even better, EVs with 100 mile range and an optional petro fuel or propane generator module to turn it into a series hybrid on long trips.  I only need the long-range capability of an internal combustion engine occasionally.  Why do I want to pay for the overhead of hauling such equipment around when I'm just commuting or running to the store?  Essentially, that's what many of us do with our internal combustion cars.  We drive a heavier, noisier, over-capable long range vehicle that's less appropriate for the short neighborhood trip, just so we have the long range capability available, even though we use it only occasionally.",1245134066

Pretending that the rules of one should apply to the other is nonsensical.<p>The reason this distinction is important is that many people claim that Apple is impinging upon their rights with the restrictions built into the OS, but they don't actually <i>have</i> any rights over the OS and ownership of the hardware does not grant them any. By analogy, owning a book does not grant you any rights over the copyrighted contents.
