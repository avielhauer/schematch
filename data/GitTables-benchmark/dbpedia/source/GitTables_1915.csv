The only thing different is that we've completely dropped use of Backbone.sync, for the sole reason that the method based approach does not fit very cleanly into what we are doing and websockets. So we have one model as a 'dispatcher' instead, to which all models send messages which are transmitted over websockets.

However, as a freelance developer who, of late, works for startups, I've been mulling this a great deal.<p>Startups are acquiring money from somewhere.  While VCs may be raising less funds and funding fewer startups, the demand for technical hires is soaring!  In my particular areas of expertise, Ruby and Ruby on Rails, demand seems, frankly insane.<p>So what's going on?  If there's less VC money in play, unless people are exiting the software development market faster than new people are coming in, one would expect that we software developers would be suffering employment issues like the rest of the US.<p>And yet I know extremely few Ruby on Rails developers who are wanting for work.<p>Is it perhaps that my perspective is limited?  I know a fairly large group of developers.  The only ones who are looking for working (and we're always looking for that next gig) are freelancers.<p>Is this the Google/Facebook ""brain-drain"" effect at work?

Old money usually came through parasitic exploitation. New money was earned in fair and honest ways: by building something. We like to talk about how our society it's meritocratic, but extra ordinary wealth earned at a young age is still looked down upon in our society. Witness the hatred of Yuppies and (outside of the Silicon Valley) dislike of startups: you're supposed to join $big_corp and work your way up through the ladder; if you shortcut by getting a high paying job right out of college you're a hated yuppie; if you shortcut by leaving for a startup, you're a traitor and a job hopper.<p>I barely use Facebook: I didn't enjoy high school (I have no desire to learn that the dude who slammed me into a locker just got engaged and is eating a sandwich) and I went to a small university where it's easy to keep in touch with classmates. I find other sites more interesting.<p>Facebook is not just Zuckerberg. It's now a corporation. The only social responsibility of a corporation (thank you Dr. Friedman) is to generate profit for their shareholders: this profit will channel into mutual funds which individuals use to retire, to philanthropic endeavours. The engineering work that goes on at Facebook (they're now endowing research fellowships) will go towards better machine learning algorithms, more efficient data centres, etc... It's almost certain that the work Facebook has put into Hadoop, for example, is helping make protein sequencing an easier task (e.g., HDFS RAID-node means being able to use a smaller replication factor, which means being able to store more data on less physical hardware!). That's the beauty of capitalism. Capitalism is sometimes horribly unfair and inefficient, but it's far better than the other systems (an immigrant from a communist country speaking here...).<p>Would the Winklevii had any interest in building our such a business? Their plan was to use hired help (what they think of you and I) to perhaps build it into a $100mm acquisition target that would rot at Yahoo, Microsoft or Newscorp; their plan wasn't to build a world class technology company.",1293772952
