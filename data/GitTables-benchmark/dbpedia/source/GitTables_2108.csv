2285,comment,2260.0,2264.0,0,0,Harj,,,"I'm a current YC company founder and I'm 21.  I see the points pg makes in that essay you quote but I can't say I've let them apply to me personally.  I have someone working for our company at the moment who is  33, in fact I don't think I've ever worked with someone who is the same age or younger than me (my co founder is 23).  I've never had a problem with it personally, in fact I probably prefer it as I can generally learn more from more older than I am.<p>To make that situation work I think you need to believe strongly in two things:<p>1) Being a good leader does not mean being the smartest/most knowledgeable person in your company.  It means being able to spot the smartest people and make them work together and learn from each other.  That's not as simple as it sounds<p>2) You MUST believe 110% that age is a completely irrelevant metric when determining the ""smartness"" of a person.  I don't care if someone is 20 years older than I am - if they haven't done a start-up then that puts me ahead of them in respect to running a start up.  They may be an infinitely better coder/designer/whatever than I am but not a better startup founder.<p>The second reason is why I ditched my career as an attorney to be a start up founder.  I don't intend on letting my income be determined by the number of years I've been sitting behind a desk.",1173074240

2280,comment,2229.0,2272.0,0,0,Alex3917,,,"I agree with you on point one.<p>As for point two, I suppose you never know what each individual is thinking. However, the aggregated wisdom tends to be fairly stable over time for any given topic. <p>For example, if the topic of Apple comes up on Digg then I pretty much know what the comments are going to say without having to click on them. If one person posts an especially insightful comment, and others recognize it as such, then chances are someone else will repost that comment in future threads about Apple. More and more people come to believe whatever is said, until someone else comes up with a new paradigm for Apple worship. So the discourse evolves, but slowly and in predictable patterns. <p>Certainly any given individual's opinions are constantly in flux, but what matters isn't the ideas of each individual brings to the system, but rather the range of diversity and novelty of thought present in the system as a whole.",1173072098
