"Railcats. A Rail Cat is a resilient cat that lives in a rail yard. During the 1890s the town of Pearland was settled along the Gulf,  Colorado, and Santa Fe rail line.  With this in mind, the mascot options for Turner College & Career High School were based on railroad themes. In October, 2012 the community voted and selected the winning mascot, the Rail Cat."
