I also spent quite some time evaluating Confluence. And what I figured out was that getting to integrate whole of our infrastructure and different existing document repositories (they're all over the place technologically and physically) would be way easier and more flexible using Atlassian suite.<p>That's because we work on so many different platforms (.Net, Domino, Java, Oracle, MSSQL,...). And since SP is very typical of MS software (great integration with anything MS - and other stuff does not exist) - for our situation an principal/technology agnostic system is much much better in the long run.<p>But as far as non-geeks go in monolythic MS stack companies - ofcourse SP is AWESOME :)",1255593434

If Google pulls shenanigans often enough, some users will notice, and they switch to Bing or some other search engine with very little effort. Google doesn't want to lose those users, so they have incentive to not be evil.<p>On the other hand, AT&T either has a physical monopoly or is part of a duopoly of broadband in many markets. If AT&T pulls shenanigans often enough, even if users do notice, they can't switch to some other provider easily. So AT&T can be evil, and people have to accept it, because there isn't much other choice.<p>If the capital costs of becoming a broadband provider were as low as being a search engine, regulation wouldn't be necessary. But since the landscape isn't competitive due to physical limitations, and AT&T has a history of being evil, regulation seems necessary.",1255592724

Sure, documents are now accessible to others, but SP does not solve the problem of explaining what the status of the document is. So you find someone else's doc, but you still may have to call or email to figure out if the doc was sent to customers, accepted, etc. As a document management platform, SP brings nothing new to the table.<p>Company functions like internal IT support, HR, etc. can easily setup simple workflows, and ticketing systems. In my opinion, this is the single best thing of SP and super valuable.<p>As a tech guy, I would never choose SP. First of all I find it too expensive, and second, the lock-in pitfalls of expensive upgrades and hours and hours of consulting to develop simple changes are just too risky (if it was my money).<p>So I agree with others in these comments, SP tries to do too much (and even more in the 2010 version), and the IE only thing just pisses me off.\n(you can actually use other browsers, but I found that some of the config stuff can only be done in IE)",1255592702

But unless you're doing something that is ultra-simple and very close to out-of-the-box, it's just not worth your time.

If you're collaborating with 5 people (hardly extraordinary) on a 2-page document, and they each have 1 distinct comment, and each of these comments requires a brief exchange (back and forth 3 times, let's say) before it's sorted out, you'll end up with a fairly messy conversation once it's all flattened out.<p>6) It's hard to attach files (particularly large or numerous files). And when you add extra people to the conversation, they don't see those files anymore. If there were multiple files sent at different time, sending all of them to the new participant is a pain in the ass.<p>7) When discussing, say, a document, correcting even a small typo requires a full email instead of being able to just dive in and correct the typo.<p>There are no doubt more, but this is what I can come up with fresh out of bed.",1255592251
