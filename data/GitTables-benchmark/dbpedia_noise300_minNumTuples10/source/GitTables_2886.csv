1,100,"From what we now know of Stalin, he seemed to believe in the basics of Marxist-Leninism. As a communist, didn't he fear that killing his own military's leadership would seriously endanger the world's only socialist experiment against capitalist rivals? 1936 moreover was several years after the rise of Hitler. Didn't Stalin realize an escalation of political tensions was going to lead to war soon? There is every indication that Stalin was a ruthless, cruel man. He also displayed moments of great opportunism and caution during his rise to political power throughout the 1930s and his later conduct of the war after 1942. What motivation beyond paranoia led to the purges, which seems like such a self-evident detrimental policy?"
2,101,"There is every indication that Stalin was pretty aware of the upcoming conflict. In 1929 Stalin started the Industrialization in order to prepare to war. In the interwar period the USSR had enough enemies even without Hitler, the most outstanding were Poland and Japan."
3,101,"Rezun-Suvorov once wrote a book which I can recommend only as a compilation of facts about the ""soviet military"" before the Purge. The book is ""Cleansing"", sorry I don't know whether English translation is available."
4,102,Are you going to substantiate that ridiculous claim?
5,103,"I'm quite surprised nobody talked about historical precedences. Stalin knew perfectly well that the main challange to the power of the absolute ruler came from within armed forces, and usually someone who's gloried from battle (see ... well pretty much entire history of Rome :) So, removing the head of officer corps who earned military glory seems like an extremely logical step to prevent any challenges."
6,103,"It's not about military talent, it's about being famous and having followers. Tukhachevsky had both. Perception is far more important than reality in politics (If Stalin needed to eliminate the most competent brass, he definitely wouldn't have left Zhukov and some of the others alive)"
7,101,"Despite some innocent and undoubtedly outstanding commanders like Rokossovsky, who were affected by the purge, it (the Purge) cleared the Army of some egregious criminal elements, who made their paths to the state service since the Revolution and the Civil War."
8,101," could you please tell me in what battle was gloried, for instance, Tukhachevsky? The only ones I remember was the use of poisonous gases against a peasant mutiny in Tambov region and his actions against the Kronshtadt uprising in 1921. But also he suggested to built 50000 to 100000 tanks in a single year (1929, as I remember, a perfect illustration for his sanity) and lost his army near Warsaw in 1920"
10,104,"It is worth noting that in 1917, in the midst of The Great War (as it was then commonly known) both the French and Russian armies mutinied. That the French mutiny ultimately amounted to little was in no small measure due to both a massive assault by British forces (the Battle of Passchendaele) that occupied German forces on the Western Front, and a declaration of War by the U.S. However the Russian Amy mutiny led ultimately to the formation of the communist government in Russia that Stalin led. With a repeat conflict against Germany on the horizon in 1936, it is likely that Stalin wanted to so terrorize and cow the officers of the army that none daring enough to organize any such mutiny again would be left . Despite the fact that the Soviet army in 1941 and 1942 was much less successful against the Germans than the Russian Army had been in 1914-1916, no threat of such a mutiny ever materialized during the Second World War."
11,105,"Yes, he made absolutely necessary steps - for his own power sake."
12,106,"""it is likely that Stalin wanted to so terrorize and cow the officers of the army that none daring enough to organize any such mutiny again would be left "". Usually, mutinies aren't organized by officers, but by soldiers."
13,104,@BernardMasse: And just who was Fletcher Christian then if not second officer of the Bounty?
14,106,The mutinies in the French army in 1916-1917 were certainly not organized by officers.
15,107,"I've got to disagree on several points. First, mutiny in 1917 was organized by soldiers, not by officers, as Bernard pointed out. Second, there were massive defections in Red Army in 1941-42, most famously 120,000-strong army led by Vlasov. Third, the purge actually increased the chances of massive defection because experienced officers were replaced by spineless cowards. Fourth, as explained in other answers, Stalin cared more about his absolute power than anything that would happen to Russia."
