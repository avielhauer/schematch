Then for each step, when we invert the outer-most corners of the square, we constrict C_2 such that the circle lies on the new outer-most points of S.<p>What happens is that as you repeat this process more and more the outer circle C_2 gets smaller and smaller, approaching the size of the original circle inside the square, C_1.<p>Also you can infer that the area of S is equal to the area of C_1 and C_2 since (area C_2) -> (area C_1) and (area C_1) <= (area S) <= (area C_2).

You've presumed the person will react unfavorably to whatever it is you're about to say. You, in a way, have suggested the person will have a bias to be negative, before you've even stated anything.<p>No one likes to hear that about themselves, so people will tend to overcompensate by being even more dispassionate than they normally are. Before anything is ever said.<p>""You're probably going to hate me for saying this, but...""<p>""You're going to think this is silly, but...""<p>""You're going to think I'm a jerk, but...""<p>I think in each case, you'll find the listener consciously or subconsciously suppress their reactions so as to not to come off as hating the other person, or thinking they are silly or a jerk.",1290366151

I was a little saddened that the replay and analyse option after games did not actually analyse games, but with the export I can download the games into my favourite chess engine and have it analyse the games for me.<p>[edit: noticed that there is a forum, don't go there. While someone occasionally posts an interesting game like <a href=""http://lichess.org/analyse/0mbole"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lichess.org/analyse/0mbole</a> the level of conversation is roughly what you'd expect from a 4chan /chess/ board.]",1290366123

Towards the middle of it.<p>---<p>Once someone has said “It’s (really) none of my business, but...” it’s entirely permissible (if slightly rude) to reply “You’re right, it is none of your business.” It’s also reasonable to reply “Well, then, don’t!” to someone who says “I don’t want to make you feel uncomfortable, but...”<p>---<p>That doesn't work as well for others, Imagine ""I am not racist but ... "" <interrupt> ""Oh, but you are racist"". So now you accused someone of being a racist. Sure you have stood up and called them on their racism, but you also created an enemy. Sometimes it is worth it, sometimes it isn't. Depending on the situation.<p>Or for example ""To be perfectly honest ... "" <interrupt> ""Oh but you are not honest"". Well now you are the one accusing them of dishonestly simply because they started the phrase with a stupid ""but-head"".<p>I think the point of the article is that some such phrases should raise red flags. They are not 100% proofs of lying or deceit.",1290366049
