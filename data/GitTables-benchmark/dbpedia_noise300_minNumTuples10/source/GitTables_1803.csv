7864470,comment,7860492.0,7864014.0,1,0,Joeri,,,"I have to admit our architecture is unconventional. It&#x27;s custom code except for a few ZF1 parts like zend_db, zend_json_service and zend_validate. Even our session and auth code is all custom. The server we use is zend server (with zend opcache). We only have web services on the server, it&#x27;s a javascript ui.<p>The web service wrapper on the server has been cut down to the essence and does not use autoloading for the basic bootstrap. I&#x27;ve found that the PSR approach of a gazillion files each containing a small class and liberal use of autoloading is inherently slow, it is death by a thousand paper cuts due to the high degree of file access, memory consumption and running of all that constructor code. The code i write typically groups a web service in a handful of files, each containing a namespace with the bulk of the implementation in procedural logic (though i do use closures quite a bit). I typically use classes / objects only as types that encapsulate data, with the logic on the object limited to that logic which is necessary for working with that type (e.g. I don&#x27;t put a save method on an object but instead write a saveObject function which accepts the object as a parameter and passes back an array of errors).<p>I suppose a lot of people nowadays find that sort of coding style blasphemous, but it is easy to write, test and maintain, and fast to execute. I&#x27;m not against the heavy OO approach common in most web dev nowadays, there are times when i do use it and need it. But CRUD web services are very linear: validate the input, create a transaction, run a bunch of db operations, commit or roll back, and return status / errors. If something is linear, i prefer to see it implemented in a cohesive linear procedural style, instead of getting chopped up into lots of objects that in practice end up obfuscating what&#x27;s happening.",1402228559

Still, it might be enabling to someone who&#x27;s already used to the delay, but in a 4-10 person band, there isn&#x27;t such an issue.<p>I have to check something, though - how do things change if all musicians tracks go through a mixer and everyone listens to his own mix in headphones. On stage, the delay from the main speakers is huge for the perfomers. That&#x27;s why they have either in-ear headphone or speaker monitor. Can&#x27;t this work for symphonic orchestras? And does it solve their latency problem?",1402225262
