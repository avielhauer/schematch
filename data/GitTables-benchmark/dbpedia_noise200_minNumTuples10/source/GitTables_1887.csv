However, there's no reason you couldn't use a BIOS designed to ignore the presence of a password.<p>If we were to design a physical analog to encryption, it would be more like a matter scrambler. You place your diamonds, jewels, insurance papers, etc. (or, in this case, incriminating evidence) onto a platform and enter a password. The contents of the platform are TRANSFORMED into a pile of pebbles, dirt, and dust which you sweep into a bag. The bag's contents are indistinguishable from anything else in your yard (Remember, GOOD encryption is indistinguishable from randomness as both encrypted data and random numbers do not compress well). The proper password will cause the matter scrambler to reproduce the valuables but otherwise will just yield more dirt, dust, and pebbles.<p>It is therefore an ACTIVE process to reproduce incriminating evidence in a case by decrypting data.

Your OS would have to have hooks into the outside software to know what the program wanted to do with a file handle. Create a new mp3? Change the info of the mp3?  Add album art?  Play the Mp3?  Delete it?  What about future features that haven't been thought of yet?<p>The outside company just wants the ability to access a file. What it does with it is not up to the OS.,1310178006

Why should they?  Do you want your Grandma making Hip Hop videos?  Meanwhile, some artists created a product during their professional lives that continues to generate revenue into their golden years.  Why should we tell them - yeah, people still buy your albums but they're public property now.  What about your ability to make money?  Hmmm...See if people will buy the new version WITHOUT John Bonham.  They won't buy it?  Oh, then here is your Social Security check.<p>The Birthday Song, on the other hand, I agree with.

Since you now have a new dependency you have to pass all the way down your callstack, it can get painful quickly.<p>You still have the issue of global state, but I think that's altogether more complicated. Sometimes state really is global to your program and exposing it everything makes a certain amount of sense. It may well be ok for managing system resources (thread pools, network connections, IO in general). I think often you can get away with a boolean flag or two shared across a whole app. If it's read-only it's not a problem at all.<p>You need to be aware that every bit of shared state you make available or continue to use is a potential source of bugs and maintenance. Every bit of this that you expose needs serious thought. Don't let it snowball. Even if it means you have to make a few extra types of object or pass a stupid number of arguments all the way down the callstack, that's usually preferable because at least then you can reason about what's going on.",1310177106
