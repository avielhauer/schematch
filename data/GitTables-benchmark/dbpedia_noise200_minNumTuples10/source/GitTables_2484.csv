,good,average,good,0,19722653,0,,good,5,AAS120,Class was fairly easy. Rana is very knowledgeable and easy to understand. Class consists of reading roughly 25-40 pages a night and filling out a study guide during class. Make sure you attend lecture or have a friend in the class since he does not put the information presented in class online.,01/13/2012,2,2.0,,3,Really into it,4.0,4.0,1,No,,1112,,,,,people,people

Rana normally gives vague explanations that are too lengthy, and not to the point. Most people would agree with me on that. He does not tie in the lecture and readings well to increase your understanding. The class itslef is great though especially if you are asian-american!",12/21/2010,2,2.0,,3,Really into it,3.5,3.5,1,Yes,,1112,,,,,people,people
