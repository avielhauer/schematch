"... the major problem with this section is it is written only for small arms, ignoring large caliber cannon interior ballistics, and there are thousands of small arms cartridges -- some of this information is true, but most cannot be generalized to ""all"" small arms cartridges, and certainly not to howitzer ammunition.  For small arms, propellant reloading manuals are the more informative and safer alternative."
