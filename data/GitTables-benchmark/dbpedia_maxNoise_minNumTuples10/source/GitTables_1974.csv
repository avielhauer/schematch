The idea was that by having the content in javascript it wouldn&#x27;t need third-party plugins and would send encrypted e-mails to an unknown address. Ideal for something like a drop box or simply to ensure that your granny can securely contact you without understanding encryption. After considerable thought and evaluation I decided against publishing it rather than risk people adopting a solution I felt that ultimately I couldn&#x27;t appropriately secure.<p>Fundamentally the biggest problems with Javascript cryptography (as far as I can tell, and I&#x27;m not a cryptographer, I&#x27;m a security specialist) are (in no particular order):<p>* Differences between implementations in different browsers, different Operating Systems, the same browser on different Operating Systems etc.<p>* Sources of randomness across different platforms<p>* Getting the Javascript to the user securely in a trustworthy manner<p>* Caching (which can be both good and bad depending on whether the point above has been resolved)<p>These are just a few of the problems without even getting to the horrible stuff like bugs in JS implementations that could either affect crypto safety or result in exploitable conditions compromising either data or the client system.<p>Java on the other hand is fairly standard across systems (to a point, but a point that can be largely controlled by the applet) and has some fairly robust crypto interfaces and 3rd-party components. That trust issue about getting the code to the target securely is still the same.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://openpgpjs.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openpgpjs.org/</a>",1376030362

6183991,comment,6183497.0,6183913.0,4,0,kevingadd,,,"I suppose? Define &#x27;bad job&#x27; - asm.js is super new and it&#x27;s a very low level representation of an application. From what I know about it (and my experience trying to produce optimal jitted JS without using asm.js at runtime), it&#x27;s very easy to produce valid, fast-looking JS that turns out to run really slow.<p>A lot of the problems here require global optimization - thinking about high level dataflow, object shapes, types, etc. asm.js eliminates some of those problems, but not all of them - if you bounce between integer and float a lot that will cost you more in asm.js, if you miss cache and branch mispredict a lot that will cost you more in asm.js, etc. A lot of the optimizations you get &#x27;for free&#x27; in a normal JS environment aren&#x27;t meaningful for asm.js, so you may have to do a lot more work in your compiler (or in this case, JIT) to hand it code that is already high quality.<p>For example, let&#x27;s say you&#x27;ve got a variable that bounces between containing a float, an integer, and null. In normal circumstances, Spidermonkey and v8 may be able to do clever things like using type information to determine that it&#x27;s safe to always store that variable as a given type, and remove that optimization the moment an int or null is written to it. There are also tricks like nanboxing, where you pack smaller types into doubles by utilizing quirks in the IEEE format - meaning that the runtime can just allocate 64-bit slots for everything, instead of having to allocate room for a type tag + the largest possible type.<p>In asm.js, you need to figure all that stuff out yourself, and do it up front in your compiler (or JIT). It expects you to have all your types figured out so if you hand it the naive solution for that problem (type tag, largest possible type) you will end up using more memory and potentially paying higher costs from always checking the tag and always copying the whole thing, where a more dynamic runtime would be able to do on-the-fly optimizations based on observations about your code. It&#x27;s a trade-off.<p>One other area where this can come up is virtual calls. Virtual calls are incredibly pervasive in languages like Java and C#, to the extent that HotSpot and the CLR actually do very clever dynamic optimizations on virtual calls (and interfaces, in the C# case) that can outperform equivalent patterns in native code. This doesn&#x27;t mean that overall Java or C# deliver better performance - they don&#x27;t - but this is one of the strengths you get from a tightly integrated JIT and language definition. At present, at least, this sort of optimization is also outside the domain of asm.js - it&#x27;s an AOT compiler, not a recompiling JIT, so it&#x27;s not going to do any magic to make your virtual calls and other pointer indirection any faster.",1376028389

By not listing the actual binary size in some denomination of bytes for the last 3 graphs (only using %s), I get less information from the charts. A much worse problem is the date formatting, which squishes all the numbers together so that they look like one big string. The first graph was much better.",1376028341

Study the other headers and there are all sorts of other things that one mailer or another leaks as well as all the servers all along the way. Most importantly, all of this is permanently stored in everyone&#x27;s email archives which most of us keep lots of. This is what the NSA wants. They want to construct the social graph, the interactions, the timings. This is how they get &quot;chatter.&quot; None of this is encrypted.

Such a huge difference suggests that providing them with housing and care would more than pay for itself, so cost ought not to be an issue. I realize that&#x27;s oversimplifying--for one thing, total cost to society is not the same as costs (and income!) to different institutions--but do you think it&#x27;s basically correct? If so, where in your view are the obstacles really coming from: moral ideas about criminality and illness? institutional politics? for-profit industry? etc.",1376028199
