But, a network can be dwarfed or subsumed no matter how strong it is, and a network may weaken over time if the facilities that bind it together are made obsolete.  A weakened network may disintegrate suddenly.<p>One example:  Everquest.  Its network-effect was dwarfed by World of Warcraft, and the gameplay didn't keep pace which led to a gradual weakening.<p>",1185308016

Does anyone know how AdSense targets ads? I bet the ad ends up on the pages that would be returned from a Google query containing the keywords. The better pagerank, the more expensive the ad. I do not have in mind a good algorithm for adpinion, but they should figure something out - Google's targeting is really good..<p>Second, upclicking doesn't matter and the button is not even needed. The only way the user indicates he likes the ad should be to click through.<p>Third, do not just count votes. Implement the best open recommendation algorithm from Netflix prize contest instead.<p>Downclicking that hides the ad is good and useful.",1185307948
