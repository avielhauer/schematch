Those are interactive and most of the processing takes place on the client side, but they cannot be embedded into email reports or PDF documents or anything else, and are very difficult for the average end-user to archive.<p>- Server-side generated images. Those are not interactive, but obviously can be embeded into anything and easily archived, so tend to be more flexible and require no extra dependencies, such as a fast JS engine or a plugin.<p>I've been working with both types for way too long, and I eventually settled on PyCha. I wrote a presets package for my apps that allow me to very quickly change every aspect of charts in bulk, and I was floored when I ran my charting benchmarks. It's also one of the few libraries that scale to a very high number of datapoints (provided you remove the line shadow).",1240772984

They're more successful at this model than any website that I can think of.<p>They are the one traditional news outlet that isn't damaged by changes in distribution methods.

I'm in 10th grade right now, and here's the way I see it: I spend a few hours in school every day, where most of the time is wasted, come home, and spend the remaining 6-8 hours of free time I have learning whatever I want.<p>I used to be pretty annoyed about school in general, but once I realised how much free time I really have, it's amazing how much I started getting done in that same time.<p>(As for the actually interesting or difficult classes, which sometimes do exist, you can do the same thing; for instance, in the first few months of my calculus class, I bought a textbook and finished learning the material until the end of the year. Now that class is just as relaxing and as much of a breeze as any other.)",1240772724

I found that I was spending too much of my time on aggregators like digg and reddit, and getting little to nothing in return.<p>Both sites, among others, are now banned via my /etc/hosts file - this is a very good technique I find. It's not permanent, but having to sudo to get to it puts in a conscience filter.<p>HN is now the only aggregator I follow regularly, and even then I've become more disciplined about how much time I spend on here.<p>Become more conscious about what you're doing.

However I'd much rather pay my money, like anyone else on the planet, to not feel like crap.<p>I worked construction, I know how painful a ripped muscle is. With ibuprofen I can continue working, because it prevents the inflammation from being more painful than my actual injury. What would anyone rather pay, 3-4 days wages while your muscle gets back to strength naturally or 3-4 hours of wages while your muscle gets back to strength with an anti-inflammatory.<p>I believe it's my right to pay as little as possible for the same quality of medicines and such, however if I want to pay $100 (or whatever) for a vaccination for the H1N1 virus, which has a very low death rate, then that's my prerogative.
