There is a complication where you need to configure pyinstaller itself for the target platform and then build the app. I scripted this though and now it builds seamlessly every time I need my app (which uses wxpython as well) to support a new platform.<p>I found this more practical than having different packaging systems for each platform. With those scripts I can now package even for systems I have zero experience with but which python runs on (e.g. AIX, HPUX, QNX).",1227863899
