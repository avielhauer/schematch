They work <i>really</i> well once you get used to them, and they tend to form a system: C-f goes forward a character, M-f goes forward a word, C-M-f goes forward an &quot;expression&quot;, and those same modifier keys have similar relationships for other commands.<p>As for ergonomics... Emacs bindings feel far more natural and comfortable than any other editor bindings I&#x27;ve ever used, but then I&#x27;ve used Emacs for a long time and am well used to them.  I suspect that the same is true for most people: what feels/works best will have more to with what you&#x27;re used to than any inherent superiority.
