In computing, the technological enabler of disruption in computing was the microprocessor. It so simplified the design of a computer that Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs could just slap one together in a garage. It transformed the industry’s fundamental technological problem—the design of a computer—from a problem that took hundreds of people several years to solve into one that was much simpler.</i><p><i>Then that simplifying technology had to be married with a business model that could take the technology into the market in a cost-effective and convenient way. Digital Equipment Corp. had microprocessor technology, but its business model could not profitably sell a computer for less than $50,000. The technology trapped in a high-cost business model had no impact on the world, and in fact, the world ultimately killed Digital. But IBM Corp., with the very same processors at its disposal, set up a different business model in Florida that could make money at a $2,000 price point and 20% gross margins—and changed the world. It’s a combination of the technology and business model that makes formerly complicated, expensive, inaccessible things affordable and accessible.</i><p><a href=""http://74.125.153.132/search?q=cache%3Asloanreview.mit.edu%2Fthe-magazine%2Farticles%2F2009%2Fspring%2F50314%2Fgood-days-for-disruptors%2F+%22every%20disruption%20has%20three%20components%20to%20it%22"" rel=""nofollow"">http://74.125.153.132/search?q=cache%3Asloanreview.mit.edu%2...</a>",1247815283
