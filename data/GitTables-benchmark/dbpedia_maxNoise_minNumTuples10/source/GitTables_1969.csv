The &quot;cloud&quot; concept isn&#x27;t entirely arbitrary.  Most clouds (unless they&#x27;re in a photograph or painting or being described abstractly using language) arise from the same physical processes and behave similarly (raining, darkening the sky and so on).  This is how &quot;cloud&quot; gets its meaning in everyday language: there really is a shared phenomenon there.<p>The error happens when we try to understand the individual physical processes underlying a particular phenomenon as part of a single object.  Even though the concept of separate objects is useful in everyday life, it no longer has meaning when you start trying to decide which cloud a given raindrop belongs to.  Why not just abandon the now-useless concept of cloud and start talking about the raindrops as individual entities with their own behavior?  Of course, we could look closely at the raindrops and see they are made of molecules: really the concept of &quot;raindrop&quot; is just another useful but ultimately imprecise bit of language.

8750928,comment,8747935.0,8750406.0,0,0,programmarchy,,,"Yes, I&#x27;m familiar with Michael Hoffman&#x27;s egodeath theory, and I agree with many of his historical perspectives and interpretations of religious experience. Like you say, his theory is hard to summarize. Relating to this thread, I think psychoactives can be a double-edged sword used for good or evil. Quoting Hoffman:<p>> Given that the Empire used entheogenic mystery-religion initiation to dominate socially and oppressively, Christianity used mystery-religion initiation to emancipate/liberate ... The religions of Jesus and Caesar were in a battle over the meaning and application of mystery-religion initiation. It&#x27;s a battle about what to do with the fact of mystery-religion initiation. [1]<p>Perhaps there were mystery cults with the best of intentions, such as the Gnostics for example, who would have had good reasons to conduct their initiations in secrecy to avoid persecution. And perhaps psychoactives can be used for &quot;short path enlightenment&quot; as Watts would say, as well as for political control.<p>What gives me pause for concern is the evidence of deep involvement on the part of the CIA with the drug counterculture. This is the same agency with a history of overthrowing democratically elected governments, conducting heinous psychological experiments on Americans, and not to mention torturing and murdering people around the world. They&#x27;re simply not to be trusted.<p>Yet we find the fingerprints of the CIA all over the origins of the so-called psychedelic revolution, even carefully crafting the terms and definitions in which to frame the discussion:<p>> In the early years of research into these drugs, psychology researchers and military intelligence communities sometimes called them, aside from “hallucinogen,” by the name “psychotomimetic” –which means psychosis mimicking. The word hallucinogen, “to generate hallucinations,” came just a few years before psychotomimetic. The same year that psychotomimetic was created we also saw the creation of the word “psychedelic” – which means “to manifest the mind.” The last stage of this etymological evolution, as we’ll see, was the word “entheogen” – which means “to generate god within.”<p>The word &quot;entheogen&quot; was a creation of Wasson and Ruck [2], which has the intended effect of framing discussions about psychoactives as spiritual phenomenon. Like Leary said, it&#x27;s all about set and setting.<p>Jan Irvin, a researcher in this field who I quoted above, has said that &quot;mysticism is the tool of tyrants&quot;. It&#x27;s hard to find cases in history of mysticism liberating individuals with so-called true knowledge. Usually, it&#x27;s been the opposite: rational, scientifically-based discovery has been the liberator from superstition, ignorance, prejudice, and authority.<p>I&#x27;ll definitely check out csp.org since this is an area of interest for me. And I&#x27;d be happy to talk about experiences via an email discussion with you at donald dot ness at gmail dot com.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.egodeath.com/SocioPoliticalResistanceAsThematicLayer.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.egodeath.com/SocioPoliticalResistanceAsThematicLa...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.gnosticmedia.com/Entheogens_WhatsinaName_PsychedelicSpirituality_SocialControl_CIA#_ednref105"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gnosticmedia.com/Entheogens_WhatsinaName_Psychede...</a>",1418626153

The way things are today, rent control basically serves as an almost permanent mutex on the development of the underlying real estate.<p>I&#x27;d be more useful if cities made it a policy that the amount of housing subsidy you receive is proportional to the year you moved to the city. That would achieve the same goal as rent control (i.e. affordable housing), but alleviates the mutex on many structures that could be torn down to make way for structures that permit great density.<p>Affordable housing programs are fine.

Unfortunately, they decided to use only 8GB of flash on all of their SSHDs. That&#x27;s a far cry from 80/20. The solid-state cache only covers 1.6% of a 500GB hybrid drive, 0.8% of a 1TB drive, and 0.2% of a 4TB drive (yes, Seagate makes 4TB SSHDs). Those Seagate drives don&#x27;t even have enough flash to hold a recent version of Windows and some commonly used apps, not to mention any games.<p>The laptop version is even worse because the non-flash part only spins at 5400rpm. Somehow they thought this would be okay in a performance-oriented drive. The slow platters make Seagate SSHDs even slower in general than regular 7200rpm laptop drives from WD and Hitachi/HGST. The only improvement is slightly shorter boot time.<p>Since the day the first generation of SSHDs came out, reviewers have said that you need at least 32GB of flash in a hybrid drive to see much real-world benefit. Everyone has also been complaining about the choice of 5400rpm. But three SSHD generations later, Seagate still hasn&#x27;t listened.<p>Now the SSHD technology is on the way to irrelevance because (1) SSDs have become much cheaper than three years ago, and (2) even if you need a lot of space, the mSATA form factor now allows most laptop users to install an SSD <i>in addition to</i>, not instead of, a 2.5&quot; hard drive.

There is no fundamental law of physics that says we can&#x27;t make it routine. The author states that they don&#x27;t think it will be feasible in our lifetime. However the amount of technological advancement that has been made over the past century is astounding. There is no reason to think this would be unfeasible.,1418624693

I can&#x27;t explain it.<p>I&#x27;m surprised that the author is saying this as I&#x27;ve experienced exactly the opposite. R completely documents all the arguments and outputs  of its functions, and documentation is easy to pull up by function, and this is almost universal both for distribution and community packages. Additionally the documentation often includes vignettes that show full examples.<p>In contrast, Python documentation is most often documented on long pages that mentions functions, but does not describe arguments or the output. I&#x27;ve found almost no Python documentation to be adequate, outside of some of the core functions. And when it is adequate, it&#x27;s exceedingly verbose, and lacking in examples, basically the worst of all worlds.",1418624676
