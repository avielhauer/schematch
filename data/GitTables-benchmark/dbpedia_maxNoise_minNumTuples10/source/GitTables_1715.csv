But to think you can't learn anything from being diverted is foolish. You can, and you can leverage that experience in a variety of ways so in that sense it is not a terminal disaster.<p>Actually, I do work in a highly competitive industry of the kind you describe, the film business, and networking and word of mouth does matter. And I've done a lot of free work to get a toehold in it - in that sense, my comments were far too general and therefore wrong. On the other hand, those were mostly cooperative ventures where everyone was working for free or nominal payment.<p>Let me rephrase: unpaid internships at well-established, highly profitable companies are a scam. If you can afford the risk of having a clueless newbie around, you can afford to pay them minimum wage. If the work needs doing, then plainly it has some economic value. So does the learning environment for the intern, but that doesn't pay the rent while they're working for you. Landlords, retailers etc. aren't in the business of giving the first one away, they tend to request money up front.<p>It's not the shitty menial work I object to, mastering those tasks with a smile is an essential quality in many industries. It's the willingness to exploit people when you can afford to pay them without any significant cost to yourself. Shitty menial work on internships does filter out people who can't get shit done, have an entitlement attitude etc. Unpaid internships filter out anyone anyone who doesn't have a financial safety net, regardless of their skillset, motivation, or potential benefit to your organization. Working a second job for that period can be impractical, considering that the eager intern wants to give 110% to show off how great they are.<p>Is it really too much to ask that in return for such a commitment, someone should get paid enough to afford food, laundry, transit and a bed to sleep in?",1246831168

When extemporizing about a topic, which happens frequently no matter how well you prepare, you may throw in extra material because you don't have time to figure out exactly which bits are necessary to form a coherent picture for your listeners.  Academics especially will err on the side of verbosity:  adding a few extra facts feels like a lesser evil than leaving an important point unaddressed.<p>* When writing a book, you have time to pick the very best and richest examples, accomplishing as much as possible with each detail.  In a lecture you may end up using many details, because each detail only illustrates a small part of what you're trying to say.<p>* Lectures are delivered live, with no opportunity for rereading, so repetition is important.  In a book, a difficult point should be stated as clearly and precisely as possible with the expectation that a reader who is confused will reread the point many times until it becomes clear.  In a lecture, you can't simply repeat yourself five times because a few of your listeners didn't understand, but you can't abandon those listeners entirely.  You have to give them time to grasp the concept while at the same time keeping your other listeners engaged.  Going over many examples and explaining the connections to related ideas serves the dual purpose of clarifying your point for those who are floundering and providing extra information for those who understood you the first time.",1246829815

Oppression is evil, sometimes the way people treat each other in the context of work is evil.  But work itself, especially hard work, is good for the soul.<p>It's not the drudgery or labor that's so satisfying. It's the sense of working on something necessary.  No one would drive rail spikes or write in machine code for fun--at least, not on the scale necessary to actually achieve something.  But once upon a time, the tasks were necessary, and those who undertook them rightly took joy in what they were achieving.  That's work.  Doing something necessary and useful is satisfying, even if it isn't fun.<p>Automate all you want; I'm all for it.  It's one of the ways we make ourselves rich.  I'd never argue that writing in machine code or taking out the garbage are inherently good for the soul, and eliminating the need for such things is good.  But while they remain necessary, they are a source of satisfaction.  There will always be tasks like that, because there will always be great things we can achieve that aren't possible without a lot of work.<p>I'm constantly pursuing projects, some for pay and some for play.  But the funny thing about projects for play: most of them I never finish.  The ones that do become great have a lot of the characteristics of work: I can see a need for them, I expect a big payoff for completion, others ask me to get them done, there's some sort of time constraint, I approach in a disciplined way and power through the dull bits.  Of course, the inverse is also true: those projects I do for pay which turn out great have a lot of aspects of play: I make them interesting, I learn things, I experiment and inject humor, I have time to make them beautiful, to do things right.  Great achievement lies in the intersection of work and play, I think.<p>I certainly wouldn't advocate unemployment, as this fellow does.  I spent a year or so unemployed, once--and with no real financial pressure to get a job.  It was absolute misery.  My creative and passionate impulses slowly dried up.

If certain characters can't be used -- eg vowels -- you might still prefer large gaps in your ID series. (If you're using a SQL database, it won't care -- but then again, if there's a SQL database anywhere in the system, its operations will make these micro-optimizations even more ludicrous than they are already.)",1246828296

It plays to a lot of peoples natural fear of flying[1] which makes the story that much better. The fact that a lot of people usually get killed helps too. Even though it's a rare event it seems like it happens all the time, simply because it's a major worldwide newsstory every single time. This tricks people into believing that flying is unsafe - they constantly see newsstories and documentaries about people who have died in an air crash.<p>People are afraid of sharks for much the same reason, even though your chance of being devoured by a shark is significantly smaller than the chance of falling down the stairs and dying<p>[1] This natural fear could well be rooted in the evolutionary advantage of being scared when you are up high looking down.

There is no post-lecture work, such as rigorous editing or re-organization of ideas.<p>* You can rant. As long as you are speaking and guiding the listener along with you, you can easily make reference to things that are explained later on or go on tangents. If you are publishing an article and go off topic, people might skip it sections all together or become confused by the switch as they only skim text.<p>* Publishing a piece of text in your name is a bigger deal than posting a video.",1246827936

NotoAir is note-taking software first and a collaboration tool second. First, you use NotoAir to take notes, stuff for like classes, etc. Then, if the note isn't personal you can make it public. So if I where taking a note for a class... I wouldn't have any good reason to keep that only to myself - so I could let other people see my notes. The application (the Air app) started as a simple html/wiki based note taking application that I decided to see if I could turn into an service and maybe eventually a product.",1246827620
