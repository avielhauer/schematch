I'd probably do something along these lines:<p>* Warn the user with as much notice as possible that they're over or close to the limit of their downgraded plan. It should be painfully obvious to the user that they're about to lose their extra privileges and data. (a red bar with warning always displayed along top of site, for example)<p>* On the day of the downgrade, send them another email saying the changeover is imminent.<p>* Actually don't downgrade them for a couple of days, but keep the message up.<p>* After those couple days, do switch over, and don't allow any write accesses other than deletes until the user has cleared the excess. Make sure your app handles this gracefully. If your app is mostly write once, read many, then put random data over the limit (their most-used files?) into ""holding"" where they can't get to it until they delete files to get under the quota. (and give a hint that they wouldn't have this problem with the more expensive account type)<p>* If they don't clear out their stuff after 2-4 weeks, just automatically delete enough data to enforce the quota. Email them a final warning a few days before the deletion.<p>But maybe that's just me and my naturally customer-friendly point of view. :)",1204050993

It claims that it is a totemic example of Ruby code.<p>There is nothing that technique X can do that technique Y cannot do given that X and Y are both Turing Equivalent. Of course you can write a library function to sum numbers. Do you also need a library function for the product of numbers?<p>If so, you now know of a salient difference between the two approaches. One needs a function for each thing you want to do, the other gives you some pieces you combine in different ways to do what you want. Is one better than the other? That's up to you to decide, you are the programmer. Ruby lets you write your program either way.<p>Now, Symbol#to_proc doesn't, in my opinion, add what I would call power. That's because you can always use a block or a lambda wherever you would use a symbol. But I may not have written the article well: the powerful and dangerous feature in Ruby is not Symbol#to_proc, it's <i>Open Classes</i>. Symbol#to_proc is an example of something you can do with an Open Class. Something else you can do with an Open Class is Hash#to_proc. Something else is Object#andand, a low-rent version of the Maybe Monad in Haskell.<p>I consider Open Classes to be powerful and dangerous. Am I advocating them? Of course not, it is up to you to decide whether they are a good idea or not. What I find interesting about them is that Rubyists are pushing the language in new directions with them, like Symbol#to_proc. The idea of a language growing from the fringe is also powerful and dangerous. The fringe is an uneducated, seething mass.",1204050515
