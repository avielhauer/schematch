SDC's, along with robotics, will eliminate the need to drive to the grocery store, or any store at all. And telecommunications surely will be pushing back against the need for central offices.<p>My hope is that SDCs will allow us to form more human-scale communities outside of the city, where we can live largely on foot, with local necessities (restaurants, bars, parks) within walking distance.  All the crap that clogs up our cities and forces us to drive (stores, mostly) will be distributed to a network of warehouses that we will never visit.<p>We may take cabs more often from place to place, but I think overall SDCs could help us drive less.<p>It's all wild speculation at this point, but I think it's very interesting to see what will happen.",1294114960
