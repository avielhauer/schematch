It's got better libraries, a bigger community, and more history.<p>If, on the other hand, you're interested in learning Lisp for the purity, the ""aha"" moments, and to become a better programmer, I'd have to recommend Scheme. It's a lot simpler, more self-consistent, with an order of magnitude less confusing bits and ""gotchas"". But it's still every bit as good at showing why Lisp is awesome.<p>And, of course, I must mention Clojure, which aside from the JVM cruft is much ""cleaner"" than CL, but just as powerful and ready for production use. It's also even more intensely focused on functional programming than Scheme OR CL.",1290319024

What we should measure is something more like earned value- did he progress more or less than one year of material forward? That way, kids who are two years behind and two years ahead all get measured on how fast they are moving, not where they started.",1290316299

You can then use a bitfield to keep track of which members actually have interesting data.<p>So -- accessing the member would look something like this:<p><pre><code>  int MyClass::get_foo() {\n    if (foo_set_)\n      return global_lookaside[this].foo;\n    return 0;\n  }</code></pre>",1290316151

Later on, you can do ""goto *ptr"" to jump back to that address.  Neat.

They're against a positive right to see a doctor and get regular treatment, but are <i>in favor</i> of a positive right to receive emergency-room care if necessary. Hence, ERs are required to treat heart-attack and stroke patients who show up on their doorstep, even if the victim is uninsured and has no ability to pay; turning them away is illegal.<p>So the question isn't over whether there's a positive right to health care--- almost everyone agrees there is to some extent. The disagreement is over which kinds of care are included in the right.",1290316106
