If you are computationally bound and not I/O or data structure bound (my biggest speedup came from exchanging lists for dictionaries to eliminate linear searching - which was a trade-off in accuracy of my algorithms vs speed, but in that specific case it didn't matter) then Cython can give pretty good results. Its also useful for wrapping C libraries.<p>As is always the case with optimizations, a good algorithm usually goes a lot further than highly optimized, low level code.",1265018330

This dividend was announced on the 18th November (roughly a month before the effective date). The share price doesn't change at that point, but on the effective date it falls by $9.70, almost exactly the dividend amount of $10. I chose this example as Sycamore gave out a quite ludicrous amount of cash (something like 35% of the company value) so the price drop is very obvious. Another unusual feature of the dividend is that the pay date is actually before the effective date. The dividend is paid on the 15th December, even though its the people who own the shares at the market open on the 16th who qualify for the dividend. This comes about due to a rule that NASDAQ have that if a distribution is greater than 25% of a company value, then the effective date is set to be the day after the pay date.<p>I think that while there is a lot that is unpredictable about the stock market, you can be fairly sure that on a dividend's effective date, the share price will fall by roughly the amount of the dividend. It won't be exact due to all the other factors which would affect a stock's price on any day, but it will be roughly correct.",1265016092

As pointed out above, the author doesn't appear to understand that the associative/non-associative distinction is literally undefined unless we're talking about a binary operator from a set to itself.  Saying that < is a non-associative operator is wrong, something like saying that a vector is a non-odd number; as long as we're complaining about parenthesization, I'd suggest the author rephrase his statement and say that < is a non-(associative operator), which at least means something.<p>An expression like a < b < c <i>should</i> be a type error - no possible parenthesization could make it a valid statement.<p>It's easy enough to come up with a way to make < work like this, though, by changing the signature of < so that it takes and returns a helper class instead of a numerical value, with automatic type coercions to that helper class from numerical values on both ends and booleans on the right edge.  This should be easy in a language like Scala, probably a 10 minute exercise if you know what you're doing.<p>If we make this helper class hold both the left edges of the chain and the right edges, and use the appropriate edge for each comparison, then the thing <i>is</i> associative.<p>((a > b) > c) > d is the same as a > (b > (c > d)), since in either case, each element will at some point be checked with > against both of its neighbors, and only those neighbors, and the overall expression will be coerced to true if and only if the strict ordering is preserved at each check.  Process left to right, and it works out.  Even if we get messier and allow >, >=, <, <=, and == into the mix, we can mix and match everything, and the whole thing will only be true if every neighboring check is true.  The author's worry in the blog comments about '1 < 2 > 1' evaluating to true strike me as odd: that <i>should</i> evaluate to true under any reasonable definition of those operators.<p>So even if we do make < into an operator such that it makes sense to talk about its associativity, it turns out to be associative.  Which is why mathematicians don't bother parenthesizing their chained < expressions, there's just no ambiguity.<p>The article is plain wrong, IMO.",1265015519
