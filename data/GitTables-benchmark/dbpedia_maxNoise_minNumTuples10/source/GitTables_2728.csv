Not Mandatory,good,good,good,0,23319359,0,,good,5,SHS200,"Very clear, concise, organized. Laughed a lot at himself and seemed pretty light hearted which was nice. Quizzes were online and you were only given 15 min, if you missed 1 question, you automatically got a B on that quiz. Other than that, if you put in the work you reaped the benefits. Good teacher all around.",05/27/2014,4,4.0,,5,Sorta interested,5.0,5.0,1,No,,1112,,,A,,people,people
Not Mandatory,poor,average,poor,0,23221518,0,,poor,1,SHS200,"He is unhelpful, rude, and his grading scale does not make sense at all. Very unresponsive to emails. Expects you to be experts even though he is terrible at teaching. All he does is read off the slides. I do not respect this professor in the slightest. He uses a weighted grading scale and it is near impossible to get an A in the class. >:(",05/11/2014,3,3.0,,1,Really into it,1.0,1.0,1,No,,1112,,,A-,,people,people

Two non-cumulative exams, six quizzes and three article critiques. Grindrod is an engaging, humorous and well-informed lecturer; however, considerable studying is required to do well in this course.",05/25/2010,4,4.0,,4,Really into it,4.0,4.0,1,No,,1112,,,,,people,people
,good,good,good,0,15928279,0,,good,4,PSYCH427,Provided USEFUL powerpoints that help both in/out of class. Daily readings help understand difficult topics but are by no means required to be read. Teaches complex topics but explains well enough. Weekly quizes are not too bad. 2 tests are like quizes but VERY long and can be hard. NO CURVE! 2 article reviews. Overall very good.
