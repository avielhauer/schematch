458698,comment,458034.0,458346.0,0,0,palish,,,"<i>... allocation/deallocation is really expensive ...</i><p>The cost of allocating memory in .NET (and probably other GC environments) is basically equivalent to the cost of incrementing a pointer, which is to say, basically free.  The reason is because the .NET garbage collector periodically ""packs together"" objects in memory, so the memory allocation algorithm essentially becomes:<p><pre><code>  result = _freeMemoryPtr;\n  _freeMemoryPtr += numBytesToAllocate;\n  return result;\n</code></pre>\n... in other words, since objects in memory are periodically ""packed together"" by the GC, there isn't a lot of memory fragmentation, so the allocator can simply allocate from the end of the heap.  It doesn't need to try to find a ""large enough free block"" within fragmented memory, because memory isn't fragmented.<p>At least, that is my understanding.  I could be wrong because I haven't investigated this thoroughly yet.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)#Generational_GC_.28aka_Ephemeral_GC.29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_sc...</a>",1233349979

For my production sites, I usually have the following setup:<p>* Replicated Database with one slave in a separate data center just as disaster recovery (not a performance thing with the separate data center). Heartbeat for the slave(s) in the same datacenter so that it stays up.<p>* Nightly backups offsite. Used to be rsync, but recently thinking of using tarsnap for the ease of it (and S3 puts it in several data centers).<p>* Files stored either in a MogileFS setup or S3 in multiple data centers.<p>It doesn't have instant failover to another data center, but the offsite DB slave should mean no data loss beyond a second or two.  Ma.gnolia is a decent sized site.  Maybe they did have a decent infrastructure and it will only be a little while before they've gotten everything back.

Read the wikipedia article, especially the last paragraph of ""Reliability"".  (Part of what's happening is that diesels have a smaller overall range, so even if the ""90% peak"" ratio is bigger, the width of the range is smaller.)<p>Also, diesel engines' fuel consumption doesn't vary as much with load as do gasoline engines'.
