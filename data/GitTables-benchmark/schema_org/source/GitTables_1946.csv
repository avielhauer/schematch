Ruby types tend to be younger, focussed on the web, probably employed as full-time  developers. Python types tend to be older and not employed as developers, but write code as part of their main jobs. Python people often have experienced a nightmare of unmaintainable Perl, that is why there is the insistence on there being one right way to do everything (which is the exact opposite of what Perl people believe). Ruby people (being younger and hence less experienced) haven't, which is  why they talk about expressiveness and do things like monkey-patching. Neither group is ""smarter"" and neither language is ""better"". The choice is a choice of what community you want to join, not a technical one.",1219412892

So every time you're contacted about a script it wouldn't hurt to say: ""We're sorry your script got posted. We'll take it down immediately.

I don't appreciate being mocked when I'm trying to have a discussion. Compilers also happen to be part of my work, but that's beside the point.<p>Introducing a new scope would, I think, introduce more corner cases than the ugliness of the new syntax. (And I do agree that it's ugly in the context of C++ which already has a function syntax.) Right now, scopes are only introduced inside namespaces, classes/structs, functions, and explicit braces. Having a new scope start <i>before</i> a function and its parameters are declared is counter-intuitive to me.<p>Now, I might actually be willing to take counter-intuitive semantics to avoid the syntactic ugliness, but that's not my point.

Over the years though, I just lost interest in it, and have come to prefer Ruby after having rediscovered it because of Rails.  It's pretty much a matter of taste: I like the syntax and convenience more.<p>One (fairly minor) real world case where the syntax makes a difference is in web templates: you can use Ruby pretty much straight up to do templating, but Python requires more hoops and hacking, due in part to the whitespace issue.  I like the fact that Ruby is flexible enough to be used as-is for templates as well as other code.  BTW, it also needs to be said that that is the <i>only</i> place I've ever noticed the whitespace issue being any kind of problem: it's not the big deal that some python detractors make it out to be.<p>In short: if you're happy with Python...great!  Keep using it, you made a good choice.  If you want to learn another language, pick something a bit further from it... say, Erlang, Tcl, Java, or C, depending on what your needs are.",1219410495
