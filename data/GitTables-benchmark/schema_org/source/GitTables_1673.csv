604212,comment,603910.0,603910.0,0,0,huhtenberg,,,"What works for me is this:<p>(a) Routinely keep an eye open for nice website designs. If I see something I like, I take a screenshot and put a little note on it as not to forget what exactly I liked. So far I have about 70 shots, and this covers a lot of ground.<p>(b) When sitting down to design the page/site, I'd pick the one that seems to fit the best and then start evolving it by changing elements that don't fit or that I don't like. This is purely subjective process, and it takes a while to converge to a stable point. All sketches are done in Photoshop, no HTML/CSS work at this point, none.<p>(c) When I have a sketch, I show it to at least 3 people, usually my wife and friends, describe the project and what feelings the design should evoke. Then ask for an overall 3-second impression as well as what ""sticks out"" or doesn't look visually pleasing. You'd be surprised how much people actually like to critique when asked.<p>(d) Fix stuff based on the feedback. Repeat (c), preferably with other set of people so that fresh eyes would look at it.<p>Additionally, I frequently need to decide between multiple (smaller) options, like the fonts, sizes, minor color variations, etc. For these I put together a side by side comparison sketch and simply ask people to tell me their preferences.<p>The feedback loop is helpful and incredibly important, because after first few sketches I cannot objectively evaluate design anymore and need fresh eyes to look at it.<p>In short - do <i>not</i> hesitate to start off someone's work. It is an A-OK. Building a portfolio of inspiration pieces is a standard way of kick starting the design. Iterating over the design tend to evolve it quite dramatically and get you to a design that is uniquely your own.<p>Secondly - if you are lacking the inspiration, have a look at sites like <a href=""http://minimalsites.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://minimalsites.com</a>, <a href=""http://pattertap.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pattertap.com</a> and similar.<p>Thirdly - unless you do this professionally, it <i>is</i> a lengthy and sometimes tedious process. It takes me on average 4 to 6 weeks to decide on a general look and feel for the site.<p>Lastly, here's a post on the subject written by a professional designer.
