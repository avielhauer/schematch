,good,poor,good,0,13865231,0,,good,4,AVI184,Larry is a fun guy. Knows his systems and teaches them pretty well - the right way. Tests are very easy if you pay attention to what he says in class. Text book can be helpful but what he says is most important. Very easy to get over 100% in class. Also a good person if you need extra help. Overall a great instructor!,12/18/2007,1,1.0,,4,It's my life,4.0,4.0,1,Yes,,1112,,,,,people,people
