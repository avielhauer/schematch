The chiefs of large hospital departments are still ""doctors"" even when they don't pick up a stethoscope for days at a time. Late in Beethoven's career, when he was almost completely deaf, no longer able to perform or even to critique other performers, he was still a ""musician"".<p>Whereas (e.g.) Joel Spolsky is now a ""manager"".

At a higher level than the average college intern, yes, but just because you're not touching a keyboard or dealing with individual calls to <i>malloc</i> doesn't mean you're not programming.<p>Unless we decide that it does.
