This is probably an improvement, since truncation can cause security problems if you're building filenames and such (though, should you fail the test accidentally, I suspect it's much harder to track down why a string somewhere in your app became empty than why it was truncated)... but is it really worth switching to yet another string copy function?<p>(well, from a BSD perspective.  Apparently strcpy_s has been around on Windows since Windows 95.)",1340510326
