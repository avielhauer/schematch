# Schematch

Please check [the Wiki](https://github.com/avielhauer/schematch/wiki) for further information on the project.

This is a research prototype for automated schema matching, mainly developed by [Alexander Vielhauer](mailto:avielhauer@informatik.uni-marburg.de)
at the Big Data Analytics group of Thorsten Papenbrock at Marburg University. Data dependencies as well as code for loading and handling them is developed by [Marcian Seeger](mailto:marcian.seeger@uni-marburg.de) (same research group).

**Please do not publish the code or data elsewhere.** This repository is only for teaching at Marburg University and Hasso-Plattner-Institut (Potsdam).

If you encounter any problems or have any questions, do not hesitate to write a mail to [Alexander Vielhauer](mailto:avielhauer@informatik.uni-marburg.de).
