This paper uses inductive counting to study the cost of simulating nondeterminism with Valiant's paradigm of unique computation---nondeterministic computation in which each input generates at most one accepting computation.  We show that unique computation can simulate nondeterministic computation with a space penalty logarithmic in the ambiguity of the nondeterministic computation tree.  Relatedly, we show that unique AuxPDAs and restricted SAC$^1$ circuits can efficiently simulate ambiguity-bounded nondeterministic computation.

Existence of a finite complete presentation of a trace monoid using rules only from another given trace monoid is proved to be reducible to the existence of a confluent semi-commutation system. Complexity results related to the preceding problems are proved: deciding the existence of finite complete presentations is $\Sigma_2^P$-complete, whereas deciding confluence of semi-commutation systems is Co-NP-complete. Additionally, an open problem about trace synchronizations is solved: The local checking property is Co-NP-complete.

Motivated by the study of various kinds of machines as recognizers of formal languages (cf. Hopcroft and Ullman, 1979), we compare the encoding and decoding power of finite state sequential machines and the following extensions thereof.  First, we show that, with a forward moving head, the best compression ratio achievable for a given sequence, to be decoded by a finite state decoder, is the same as the best ratio attainable for that sequence when encoded by a finite state encoder to move its head back and forth on an input sequence, even if the decoder has unrestricted power.  However, better compression can be achieved for specific infinite sequences using an unrestricted encoder and a two-way finite state decoder.",

We prove various closure results such as the closure under boolean operations (for recognizable languages), concatenation and left and right quotients by recognizable sets.

The following results are shown.  (1) Any single-valued real-time transducer $M$ with $n$ states can be effectively transformed into an equivalent unambiguous real-time transducer having at most $2^n$ states.  (2) Let $M$ be a single-valued real-time transducer with $n$ states and output alphabet $\Delta$ which is equivalent to some deterministic real-time or subsequential transducer $M'$.  Then, $M$ can be effectively transformed into such an $M'$ having at most $1 + 2^n \cdot \max \{ 2 , \# \Delta \}^{2 n^3 l}$ states where $l$ is a local structural parameter of $M$.  (3) For any single-valued real-time transducer $M$ it is decidable in deterministic polynomial time whether or not it is equivalent to some deterministic real-time transducer (to some subsequential transducer, respectively).  The results (1)--(3) can be extended to the case where $M$ is not necessarily real time.  The upper bound in (1) is at most one state off the optimal upper bound.  Any possible improvement of the upper bound in (2) is greater than or equal to $2^n - 1$.",

Recently, Abiteboul and Vianu [Abiteboul and Vianu, 1991b] investigated the relationship of these two logics in the absence of an ordering, using a machine model of generic computation.  In particular, they showed that the two languages have equivalent expressive power if and only if P = PSPACE.  These languages can also be seen as fragments of an infinitary logic where each formula has a bounded number of variables, $L^\omega_{\inf\omega}$ (see, for instance, [Kolaitis and Vardi, 1990]).  We investigate this logic of finite structures and provide a normal form for it.  We also present a treatment of the results in [Abiteboul and Vianu, 1991b] from this point of view.  In particular, we show that we can write a formula of FO + LFP that defines an ordering of the $L^k_{\inf\omega}$ types uniformly over all finite structures.  One consequence of this is a generalization of the equivalence of FO + LFP and P from ordered structures to classes of structures where every element is definable. We also settle a conjecture mentioned in [Abiteboul and Vianu, 1991b] by showing that FO + LFP is properly contained in the polynomial time computable fragment of $L^\omega_{\inf\omega}$, raising the question of whether the latter fragment is a recursively enumerable class.",

The complexity of communication algorithms is measured by the number of communication steps (rounds).  Here, the complexity of gossiping in grids and in planar graphs is investigated. The main results are the following: \begin{enumerate} \item Effective one-way and two-way gossip algorithms for $d$-dimensional grids, $d \geq 2$, are designed.  \item The lower bound $2\log_2 n - \log_2 k - \log_2 \log_2 n - 4$ is established on the number of rounds of every two-way gossip algorithm working on any graph of $n$ nodes and vertex bisection $k$. This proves that the designed two-way gossip algorithms on $d$-dimensional grids, $d \geq 3$, are almost optimal, and it also shows that the 2-dimensional grid belongs to the best gossip graphs among all planar graphs.  \item Another lower bound proof is developed to get some tight lower bounds on one-way ``well-structured'' gossip algorithms on planar graphs (to the best of the authors' knowledge, to date all gossip algorithms designed in vertex-disjoint paths mode have been ``well-structured'').  \end{enumerate}",

Here, we provide the first solution for the more general case where the original program can be nondeterministic (e.g., randomized).  Our scheme is based on a novel agreement protocol for the asynchronous parallel setting.  Our protocol allows $n$ asynchronous processors to agree on $n$~\emph{word-sized} values in $O(n \log n \log \log n)$ \emph{total work}, assuming an oblivious adversary scheduler.  Total work is defined to be the summation of the number of steps performed by all processors (including steps from busy waiting).",spaa::AumannBZ1996

We show that for each fixed $k \ge 1$, the class of graphs allowing such routing schemes is closed under minor-taking in the domain of connected graphs, and hence has a linear time recognition algorithm.  This result connects the theory of compact routing with the theory of graph minors and treewidth.  We show that every graph that does not contain~$K_{2,r}$ as a minor has treewidth at most~$2r - 2$.  As a consequence, graphs that allow $k$-label Interval Routing Schemes under dynamic cost edges have treewidth at most~$4k$.  Similar results are shown for other types of Interval Routing Schemes.",

These results are applied to the study of permutation structures, linear orderings, equivalence relations, and Abelian groups.  For example, conditions on two permutation structures $(A, f)$ and $(B, g)$ are given which imply that $(A, f)$ and $(B, g)$ are p-time isomorphic.",

Our objective is to minimize the \emph{average response time} of the system.  In alternative formulation this is known as the \emph{Minimum Color Sum} (\emph{MCS}) problem (E.~Kubicka and A.~J. Schwenk, 1989. An introduction to chromatic sums, \emph{in} ``Proceedings of the ACM Computer Science Conference,'' pp.~39--45.).  We show that the algorithm based on finding iteratively a maximum independent set (\emph{MaxIS}) is a 4-approximation to the~MCS\@.  This bound is tight to within a factor of~2.  We give improved ratios for the classes of bipartite bounded-degree, and line graphs.  The bound generalizes to a $4\rho$-approximation of~MCS for classes of graphs for which the maximum independent set problem can be approximated within a factor of~$\rho$.  On the other hand, we show that an $n^{1-\epsilon}$-approximation is NP-hard, for some $\epsilon > 0$. For some instances of the resource allocation problem, such as the \emph{Dining Philosophers}, an efficient solution requires \emph{edge coloring of the conflict graph.  We introduce the \emph{Minimum Edge Color Sum} (\emph{MECS}) problem which is shown to be NP-hard.  We show that a 2-approximation to $\mathrm{MECS}(G)$ can be obtained distributively using \emph{compact coloring} within $O(\log^2 n)$ communication rounds.",

We do so by considering the problem of boosting the accuracy of weak learning algorithms which fall within the SQ model.  This new model was introduced by Kearns to provide a general framework for efficient PAC learning in the presence of classification noise.  We first show a general scheme for boosting the accuracy of weak SQ learning algorithms, proving that weak SQ learning is equivalent to strong SQ learning.  The boosting is efficient and is used to show our main result of the first general upper bounds on the complexity of strong SQ learning.  Since all SQ algorithms can be simulated in the PAC model with classification noise, we also obtain general upper bounds on learning in the presence of classification noise for classes which can be learned in the SQ model.",
