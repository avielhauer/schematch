52,Construction of a 1-deg x 1-deg fossil fuel emission data set for carbonaceous aerosol and implementation and radiative impact in the ECHAM4 model,,"Global-scale emissions of carbonaceous aerosol from fossil fuel usage have been calculated with a resolution of 1 deg x 1 deg. Emission factors for black and organic carbon have been gathered from the literature and applied to domestic, transport, and industrial combustion of various fuel types. In addition, allowance has been made for the level of development when calculating emissions from a country. Emissions have been calculated for 185 countries for the domestic, industrial, and transport sectors using a fuel usage database published by the United Nations (1993). Some inconsistencies were found for a small number of countries with regard to the distribution of fuel usage between the industrial and domestic sectors. Data from the fuel use database for the period 1970-1990 were used to correct for this. Emissions based on total particulate matter (TPM) and submicron emission factors have been calculated. Global emissions for 1984 of black carbon total 6.4 TgC/yr and organic carbon emissions of 10.1 TgC/yr were found using bulk aerosol emission factors, while global black carbon emissions of 5.1 TgC/yr and organic carbon emissions of 7.0 TgC/yr were found using submicron emission factors. Use of the database is quite flexible and can be easily updated as emission factor data are updated. There is at least a factor of 2 uncertainty in the derived emissions due to the lack of exactly appropriate emission data. The emission fields have been introduced into the ECHAM4 atmospheric general circulation model and run for five model years. Monthly mean model results are compared to measurements in regions influenced by anthropogenic fossil fuel emissions. The resultant aerosol fields have been used to calculate the instantaneous solar radiative forcing at the top of the troposphere due to an external mixture of fossil fuel derived black carbon and organic carbon aerosols. Column burdens of 0.143 mgBC/sq m and 0.170 mgOC/sq m were calculated. (Author)",Yes,English,Journal-of-Geophysical-Research,IAA199911,,,Environment-Pollution
66,Characterization of solar coronal holes and plumes using spectroscopic diagnostic techniques applied to SOHO/CDS observations,,"Results from a series of SOHO/Coronal Diagnostic Spectrometer (CDS) observations of coronal holes and plumes are presented, including analysis of a low-latitude plume observed in August 1996. Spectroscopic diagnostic techniques using the CHIANTI atomic database are applied to derive the plasma parameters: electron density, temperature, and element abundances. The results are compared with quiet sun values. Coronal electron densities in the holes are found to be about 2 x 10 exp 8/cu cm, a factor of two to three lower than in the quiet sun. The plasma thermal distribution exhibits differences between coronal holes, the quiet sun and plumes. For example, the peak of the emission in coronal holes is at a lower temperature (T approximately equal to 8 x 10 exp 5 K) than in the quiet sun (T approximately equal to 1 x 10 exp 6 K), while plumes are cooler (T approximately equal to 7.6 x 10 exp 5 K) and show a different distribution, closer to an isothermal state.

71,Automatic correlated terrain database generation and management for ground vehicle simulators,,"Work described in this paper extends prior developments on correlated terrain databases specifically focused on driving simulation applications by adding key features on usability, correlated data generation, singularities, and performance. Key features of the earlier system included variable resolution storage, real-time execution time independent of the size of the database, and the ability to model vertically stacked terrain with minimal runtime overhead. Improvements of the new system include the automation of the database generation process given the source code of the visual databases, a new interrogation technique that eliminates distracting artifacts that appear across areas that have been sampled at different resolutions, and the use of graphical interactive tools for verifying the correlation of the final terrain database against the original visual model. The paper includes examples that demonstrate the process, along with information on the performance of the code under various conditions and computing systems.

Planetary companions with more than about 3 Earth radii should produce detectable occultations at the accuracy of our measurements. The observations started in spring 1994 and are still going on. Eight observatories have participated so far: Haute Provence (France), Lick (USA), La Palma (Spain), Rochester (USA), Skinakas (Greece), Taejon (Korea), Teide (Spain) and Wise (Israel). We have obtained a homogeneous dataset by using CCD detectors with standard broadband filters (V and R) and maintaining always common reference stars between all the observatories. So far, we have obtained about 500 hours of effective integration time on CM Dra, distributed in about 16,000 CCD frames.

140,Integrated monitoring and control - A new approach,,"This article presents the architecture of a new integrated monitoring and control (M&C) system that has been implemented for several of the ground-segment subsystems involved in the processing and dissemination of the vast quantities of data produced by the European Space Agency""s European Remote-Sensing Satellite (ERS). Some of the original M&C subsystems of the ERS satellite""s ground segment have been replaced with a new system called MIMS (Multi-mission Integrated Monitoring System). The key concept of MIMS is to gather together as much system status information as is required to furnish a reliable picture of the operational situation of the ground-system components. This information is collected from the managed systems through M&C ""agents"" and stored in a database for further analysis and presentation. The M&C functionality is described, with discussions presented on object status definition and representation, data collection and agent interface, Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) in the MIMS infrastructure, event and anomaly handling, and statistics generation. An essential aspect of MIMS is the integration of commercial software packages. The various interacting components are listed, described, and diagramatically shown. The network-management product HP-OpenView NNM has been put at the core of MIMS. The main characteristics of OpenView NNM are outlined, and the event-collection and storage subsystem are shown in a diagram. The HP-OpenView Extensible Simple Network Monitoring Protocol (SNMP) Agent is addressed. A hierarchical manager-to-manager communication, using the SNMP trap mechanism, was chosen to link MIMS to relevant status messages of the external commercial network services.

143,Aircraft design problem implementation under the Common Object Request Broker Architecture,,"The paper describes a component-based computational environment for implementing aircraft design problems. The environment is conducive to taking advantage of the parallelisms inherent in the problem and distribute the individual disciplines on machines most appropriate to their needs while insulating the developer and the user from the complexity of the underlying communications constructs. Common Object Request Broker Architecture and Java programming language are used to encapsulate discipline codes as ""objects"". An interface file identifies all the information needed by a user of the object. Legacy codes are ""wrapped"" using Java""s native interface methodology and each such code is called from a module which implements the services of the object. A server program ties the implementation to the interface. Data and file management are accomplished using Java""s database connectivity to access a commercial relational database management system. Java""s Beans Development Kit is used to implement the disciplines and subtasks as reusable components that provide a graphical interface for user input as well as facilitate interactive and visual object connectivity and problem execution progress monitoring. This approach has been used to implement a simple aircraft design optimization problem, the analysis part of a large-scale high-speed civil transport design optimization problem, and a standalone aerodynamic optimizer.

186,"The anatomy of a buried complex impact structure - The Mjolnir Structure, Barents Sea",,"Analysis of the prominent seismic disturbance at the 40-km-diameter Mjolnir impact structure, based on an extensive seismic reflection database, shows that the observed broad-brimmed bowl-shaped disturbance was formed as a result of the impact of an asteroid or comet during Volgian-Berriasian time (149-141 Ma). Seismic mapping exhibits and visualizes a 850-1400 cu km disturbed volume and analysis of several structural features within the disturbance provides insight into major cratering processes, such as brecciation and excavation, melting, gravitational collapse of the transient crater, and structural uplift. A transient crater of 16 km in diameter and 4.5 km in depth is determined. From transient and final crater dimensions we obtain an estimate of the degree of gravitational collapse of the order of 2.5, considerably larger than the average expected values for typical terrestrial craters. The extensive collapse took place by low-angle decollement surfaces at the periphery and by chaotic debris mass flows toward the center. Furthermore, we estimate the Mjolnir projectile to have been 0.9-3 km in diameter, and that the physical impact released energy in the range of 2.4-53 x 10 exp 20 J, corresponding to an earthquake of magnitude 8.3. The Mjolnir impact is not associated with a significant mass extinction. (Author)",Yes,ENGLISH,Journal-of-Geophysical-Research,IAA199903,,,GEOPHYSICS-

279,Development of a 3D stereoscopic flight guidance display,,"As part of an interdisciplinary research project, sponsored by the German Research Community (DFG), the Darmstadt University of Technology is investigating the potential offered by stereoscopic flight guidance displays for improving pilot situation awareness. The research aims to formulate ergonomic design recommendations for this type of display. Recent developments in display technology offer new opportunities to improve human-machine interfaces in the cockpit. The utilization of three-dimensional display symbology, as a depiction of three-dimensional sensor or database information, has become an accepted practice in modern enhanced and synthetic vision systems. Nevertheless, the information is depicted on a conventional two-dimensional screen. This can cause problems and errors during the cognitive process of depth perception. The application of stereoscopic technology can add an additional cue which is intuitively seized by the observer. The project concentrates on stereoscopic perspective flight guidance displays as a head down display. The extension to other display types like navigation or head-up display is possible. Because of the complexity of a modern synthetic vision display, the project contains experiments on different levels of abstraction, ranging from classic parameter experiments to flight simulator tests. The stereoscopic layout takes into consideration specific informational needs within different flight phases and is evaluated by means of pilot performance and pilot strain.

291,Using NOAA AVHRR NDVI to identify SO2-induced vegetation stress in Central Europe,,"A multitemporal database consisting of mean monthly normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for each growing season, at a spatial resolution of 8 x 8 km from 1982-1993, was established for central Europe (between 46 deg N and 55 deg N and 8 deg E and 28 deg E). Data for aerial SO2 and elevation were used to stratify NDVI observations into zones of vegetation stress ranging from 0 to 72 micrograms/cu cm per yr. Vegetation stress is quantified strictly as an aerial SO2 and as a combination of aerial SO2 and elevation. Peak 1992 growing season NDVI from zones of lower aerial SO2 are higher than peak NDVIs observed for areas with higher aerial SO2. The inclusion of elevation as a constraint yielded increasing NDVI with elevation within all aerial SO2 categories. No negative trends in peak growing season NDVI were identified throughout the 1982-1993 period. It is concluded that the coarse spatial resolution of the NOAA/NASA Pathfinder Land data set limits its usefulness for studying forest damage.

The galaxies have positions accurate to about 1 arcsec and magnitudes with an rms scatter of about 0.3 mag. We compute magnitudes (mSSRS2) from the relation between instrumental GSC magnitudes and the photometry by Lauberts and Valentijn (1989). From a comparison with CCD photometry, we find that our system is homogeneous across the sky and corresponds to magnitudes measured at the isophotal level about 26 mag/sq arcsec. The precision of the radial velocities is about 40 km/s, and the redshift survey is more than 99 percent complete to the mSSRS2 = 15.5 mag limit.

582,STIS signal-to-noise capabilities in the ultraviolet,,"The Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) was designed as a versatile spectrograph for the HST capable of maintaining or exceeding the spectroscopic capabilities of first-generation HST instruments primarily through the use of large areal detectors in both the UV and visible regions of the spectrum. Simultaneous spatial and spectral coverage is provided through long-slit or slitless spectroscopy of extended sources. A substantial spectral multiplexing advantage is achieved for UV echelle spectroscopy. This paper will focus on the key issue of S/N performance with the STIS UV detectors. Spectra obtained during the first few months of operation illustrate that high S/N spectra can be obtained while exploiting STIS multiplexing advantage. From analysis of a single spectrum of GD 153, with count statistics of 165, a S/N of 130 is achieved per spectral resolution element in the far-UV for a flat-fielded spectrum. In the near-UV, a single spectrum of GRW +705824, with count statistics of 200, yields an S/N of 150 per spectral resolution element for the flat-fielded spectrum. Without flat-fielding, a S/N of 100 is achieved. An even higher S/N capability is illustrated through the use of the fixed pattern split slits in the medium-resolution echelle modes. These results verify that STIS is capable of achieving a S/N in excess of 100:1 per spectral resolution element in both the first-order and echelle modes.

The synthetic component of the system provides a 40-deg vertical by 80-deg horizontal image of terrain and local features. The enhanced component digitizes imagery from electro-optic sensors and fuses the sensor image as an inset (20 by 25 deg) within the synthetic image. Symbology can be overlaid in any location within the synthetic FOV and may be head, aircraft, target or terrain referenced. Active sensor (laser or radar) data will be fused with the synthetic data base in real time to update the synthetic image content. To establish system performance as well as human interface requirements, the program has been supported by an extensive series of human-in-the-loop studies in university, company, and government laboratories. A brief summary of some of the experimental results is included.

The benefits of adding shielding to a satellite must be weighed against the costs, whilst simultaneously considering other strategies, such as critical component relocation.

This paper introduces the control system of the ELF and shows the results of a flight test on a small sounding rocket. By adopting high-speed position detectors and a field programmable gate array technique, rapid calculation of material""s position up to 1000 Hz is realized. The flight data show that complete melting/solidification of the material (0.5 g BiFeO3) was accomplished. Though motion was fully controlled during the experiment, unexpected shaking occurred at high temperature due to a sudden drop of electrostatic charge.

742,Automated rule extraction for engine vibration analysis,,"A problem in engine health monitoring is the automatic detection and classification of potential component failures. Current processing uses simple features to measure and characterize changes in sensor data. An alternative solution uses neural networks coupled with appropriate feature extractors. Unfortunately, most neural nets give little insight into the ""why"" of their output decisions. We have developed a variation of the radial basis function neural net for the problem. The neural net is essentially a nearest neighbor classifier. Classification rules can be found by examination of the basis functions. Rule complexity is reduced by using evolutionary programming to select the input features and neural net architecture. The technique is applied to complex vibration spectral data to yield a simple rule that gives superior performance when compared to a traditional approach. The approach is a valuable tool for developing simple rules when a large feature set is available.

940,Alleviation of deformation of cylindrical shell using piezoelectric rings,,"A methodology for alleviating the deformation of cylindrical shells has been developed, using piezoelectric ring stiffeners bonded to the surface of the shell to counteract deformation caused by external loads (gravity, internal pressure, and temperature change). The function of the piezoelectric ring stiffeners may be realized by their electrically induced strains, causing pressure on the surface of the shell. These strains can, at desirable locations, produce adjustable deformations in the opposite direction of the deformations caused by external loading. Conventional differential equations governing displacements of linearly elastic cylindrical shells are used. For computer simulation, a simply supported thin cylindrical shell having 18 piezoelectric ring stiffeners bonded to its outer surface along the length of the shell is considered. Deformations along two generatrices of the shell are computed to demonstrate the effect of alleviation. Since the deformation produced by an individual ring stiffener depends on the magnitude and polarity of the applied voltage, it is possible to counteract deformations caused by any other type of loading. Simulated results show that the deformation of cylindrical shells can be effectively alleviated. (Author)",Yes,English,Journal-of-Aerospace-Engineering,IAA199911,,,Structural-Mechanics

Typically, thresholding or segmentation techniques are used to obtain crisp object boundaries before object properties are computed. In this correspondence, we explore the possibility of using fuzzy definitions for measuring object properties without having to make crisp decisions about object boundaries prematurely.

A crucial parameter for snowmelt runoff modeling is the snow covered area. Methods have previously been developed for mapping snow cover in alpine basins using medium and high resolution optical data and for mapping wet snow using SAR data. An objective of HyDalp is to determine the applicability of these methods to high latitude basins. This paper discusses the applicability of the SAR wet snow mapping method to high latitude basins and highlights differences with respect to alpine areas. We wish to determine if wet snow causes a detectable change in backscatter as compared to no or dry snow cover, what the detection and false alarm rates are, what other dynamic changes occur within the image, and whether these could be mistaken for wet snow.

Dynamic-motion unstructured technology (DUT) and an FEM are used to solve the 3D Euler equations on dynamic meshes. The aerodynamic interference between the components is obtained first by solving a series of static cases along a prescribed staging path during Mach 5 flow. Then, a two-DOF motion is prescribed for the booster and the connector arm and dynamic-motion simulations are obtained. The results demonstrate the dependence of the unsteady forces and moments on the mutual interference. Further, they indicate that the staging process has significant influence on the flowfield around the vehicle and its aerodynamic loading. The interference appears to be a highly nonlinear function of the separation distance.

The objective is not only to identify the nominal model but also to quantify the modeling error with sup-norm bounds in the frequency domain. The uncertainty to be identified and quantified is chosen as the nu-metric, proposed by Vinnicombe (1993), because of its compatibility with H-infinity-based robust control. An algorithm is developed to model the normalized coprime factors of the given plant using techniques of discrete Fourier analysis (DFA) and balanced stochastic truncation (BST) and is shown to be robust in the presence of the worst case noise. Upper bounds are derived for the associated modeling error based on the minimum a priori information of the underlying model set and of the noise level in the measurement data.

The key issues addressed in this paper primarily concern spectral analysis software, data handling and interpretation, standards, spectral libraries, national policy, and international cooperation/collaboration. The latter issue is included because advances in many aspects of spectral technology are being driven from outside the United States. This paper considers and expands on the concept of using the Internet as a means for managing digital spectral information worldwide and suggests that everyone can benefit by being more proactive in his or her use of the resulting Web digital spectral library (DSL) for reward and communication. Resolving the critical issues presented in this paper concerning spectral technology is important, because this technology is increasingly becoming incorporated into modern civil and military remote sensing systems, and the resultant greater integrated system performance is synergistic to newly evolving commercial, civil, scientific, and military applications.

1476,Information architecture analysis and optimization for space-based distributed radar,,"The large data volumes present in proposed space surveillance systems shift the burden of effective performance from sensor technology to information technology. The Air Force Research Lab`s (AFRL`s) TechSat21 proposal represents a Ground Moving Target Indication (GMTI) system utilizing clusters of small (or micro) satellites. Using interferometric techniques the cluster is able to synthesize the sensitivity of an antenna of dimension comparable to the size of the cluster itself. The aggregate rate of data collection for a single cluster can exceed 36 GBps. The logistical problems with maintaining such high bandwidth communication to mobile ground stations in an active theater drive the design of such a system towards onboard processing. This decision in turn determines the requirements for intersatellite communication and radiation-tolerant signal processing hardware. This study examines candidate architectures for distributed signal processing with reference to analogs in terrestrial parallel and distributed computing. Included in the analysis are discussions of requirements and possible approaches to communications, data storage, and computational load sharing. Strategies are suggested for efficient load assignment and data dissemination.

1500,Impact flux variations around SFU as derived from payload unit and EFFU MLI blankets,,"The Space Flyer Unit (SFU) spacecraft was retrieved in January 1996 and since that time an extensive post flight investigation has been undertaken. Over the past two years we have reported the continuing results from micrometeoroid and debris impact investigations. This paper discusses the results of the impact survey of the SFU spacecraft, with special consideration given to the direction and nature of the derived fluxes. The impact signatures on multilayer insulation and second surface mirrors vary considerably due to the material composition (aluminized Kapton, silverized Teflon) and due to the structure (multilayers of Kapton interspaced with Dacron net, Teflon bonded to a honeycomb sandwich). Detailed analyses using not only CCD image data but also 3D laser microscopy and X-ray CT scans have revealed a wealth of information relating to the visual features observed on these materials. The flux distribution as a function of spacecraft location is discussed in detail, incorporating newly published data from the Exposed Facility Flyer Unit peripheral faces.
