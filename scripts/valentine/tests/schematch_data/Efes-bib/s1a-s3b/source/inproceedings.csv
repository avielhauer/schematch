Balzer1989,Draft Report on Requirements for a Common Prototyping System,ACM Sigplan Notices Volume 24 Number 3 March.,1989,,,,,,> DEng>,,Describes a proposed DARPA research program to take 4 years and result in a unified protoyping environment and language. A prototype is a program built in order to obtain information useful in the construction of a future production system. Such information make take the form of performance estimates of algorithms and implementation strategies or experience with the adequacy of a proposed user interface. In order to be economoically justified a prototyping system must support very rapid development and have a strong instrumentation facility. On the other hand the protoype need not be as efficient as the production version it may implement only a portion of the eventual application and it may require manual intervention in order to run. The document describes requirements for an environment and system and expresses the opinion that while no individual part of the project requires a great advance in the state of the art bringing all the pieces together into a unified system is likelyt to prove very challenging. Database and communication facilities required include: 1) A persistent object store a) An application specific component to store objects needed by the application in its execution including test cases etc. b) protypes themselves their components and information about them including version histories and the results of instrumented prior runs. c) Definitions of types and abstractions used or produced by a prototype. These should be stored by the system to facilitate composition and inter-language communication 2) Call-in/Call-out. Prototypes will be written using multiple languages (typically Lisp and ADA and perhaps more specialized constructs as well.) Modules need to be able to share objects across language boundaries and there needs to be an encapsualtion facility so that a module may be implemented in different languges during the prototype development process.
