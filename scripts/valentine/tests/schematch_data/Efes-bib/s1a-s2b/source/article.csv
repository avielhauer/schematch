Was called `Counting Unique Values of An Attribute Without Sorting'. / The idea is to estimate the size of a projection of a relation without looking at the entire relation. Still needed are techniques for estimating the size of a join (of many relations) without actually computing the join. That's what we need if we are going to decide on the proper order in which to join *large* numbers of relations.---jeff
