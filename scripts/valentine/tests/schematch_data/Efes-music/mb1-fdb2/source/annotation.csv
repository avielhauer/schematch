Baptized as: Joannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart

Mozart himself preferred the Italian-ized and French-ified versions of Gottlieb: Amadeo, Amadè and Amadé

Mozart actually only ever used the name as ""Amadeus"" three times among his letters and compositions, among at least 77 different variations of his name used throughout his lifetime.

Due to a recent edit ([http://musicbrainz.org/edit/22578603|link]) that changed his name from ''Georg Friedrich Händel'' to ''George Frideric Handel'' (no artist credits renamed), majority of the releases filed under this artist are still left with the old artist name (Georg Friedrich Händel).

Apparently, there are discrepancies within recording titles and work titles for Mozart's '''violin sonatas''' due to early usage of a practically obsolete numbering system (AMA). Some editors probably used the catalog numbers of works alreadyy existing on the mb database and copied it to the recording title, resulting in a lot of recordings with incorrect (obsolete) names, also resulting to inconsistent recording names.

History:
The old by Breitkopf & Härtel (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozarts Werke) commonly referred to as 'AMA' had 43 Violin Sonatas. K. 55-61 were removed from the old catalog as they were deemed spurious (not by Mozart), resulting to a renumbering of the Violin Sonatas, refer to the table below:

Old catalog | Koechel catalog | New Catalog
#25 = K301 ('''18''')
#26 = K302 ('''19''')

Apparently, there are discrepancies within recording titles and work titles for Mozart's '''violin sonatas''' due to early usage of a practically obsolete numbering system (AMA). Some editors probably used the catalog numbers of works alreadyy existing on the mb database and copied it to the recording title, resulting in a lot of recordings with incorrect (obsolete) names, also resulting to inconsistent recording names. (''Try doing a quick browse of the works in question, i.e., the affected works ar probably Nos. 18/25-43'', might vary depending on what catalog the work is using)

History:
The catalog old by Breitkopf & Härtel (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozarts Werke) commonly referred to as 'AMA' had 43 Violin Sonatas. K. 55-61 were removed from the old catalog as they were deemed spurious (not by Mozart), resulting to a renumbering of the Violin Sonatas, refer to the table below:

Apparently, there are discrepancies within recording titles and work titles for Mozart's '''violin sonatas''' due to early usage of a practically obsolete numbering system (AMA, see this [http://wiki.musicbrainz.org/CSG_Standard/Mozart#CatAMA|link]). Some editors probably used the catalog numbers of works alreadyy existing on the mb database and copied it to the recording title, resulting in a lot of recordings with incorrect (obsolete) names, also resulting to inconsistent recording names. (''Try doing a quick browse of the works in question, i.e., the affected works are probably Nos. 18/25-43'', might vary depending on what catalog the work is using)

''History:''
The catalog old by Breitkopf & Härtel (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozarts Werke) commonly referred to as 'AMA' had 43 Violin Sonatas. K. 55-61 were removed from the old catalog as they were deemed spurious (not by Mozart), resulting to a renumbering of the Violin Sonatas, refer to the table below:
