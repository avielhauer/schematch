492569,502288,"Solipsism is Craig Murphy, an Experimental Musician and Recording Artist from Glasgow in Scotland. His cross-genre style incorporates elements of Ambient, Techno, IDM, Electro and Experimental Music and his releases have been featured on various Radio Stations from across the Globe, including BBC Radio 1, BBC6 Music, XFM London and Digital Nimbus (U.S.A). 
He is also a member of the Psychedelic/Folk band Shoosh, alongside Ed Drury and Neil Carlill. The latter who had several Top 40 hits in the UK with his band Delicatessen (Rough Trade, Big Life). Shoosh have released music on Awkward Silence Recordings and Herb Recordings. Murphy founded the Independent Record Label Herb Recordings in 2006 and he continues to run it to this day. Herb Recordings is distributed on CD by Cargo Records of London and on Digital Formats by State51 also of London. Previously they have been distributed by Amato and INGrooves. Main Site: http://solipsism.bandcamp.com | http://herbrecordings.bandcamp.com Label Site: http://www.herbrecordings.com Physical Distribution: http://www.cargorecords.co.uk Digital Distribution: http://www.state51.co.uk 
Herb Recordings has released albums globally by many Artists both from the UK and abroad, such as; Kingbastard, Engine7, Skytree, Shoosh, Solipsism, Jack Marchment, Haz, Shamanic Technology and Mosca. The Label was set up by Solipsism as a platform to release music that had the right blend of melody and experimentalism at a time when Electronic Music was being dominated by Producers rather than Musicians. Herb Recordings therefore became a platform for Producers who were also serious Musicians and as such, their output has warmth that’s often lacking in contemporary Electronic Music. 
After Amato Distribution of London went into administration in October 2008, the Label switched both their Physical and Digital operations to Cargo Records. They remain with Cargo Records for Europe-wide CD and Vinyl distribution, but as of February 2011, they have been distributed on Digital Formats by State51. State51 specialises in Experimental, Independent Labels and also distributes the likes of The Leaf Label, Lo Recordings and Twisted Nerve. In 2010 Herb Recordings was nominated as one of the Top Ten Experimental labels by the highly respected Igloo Magazine. The full article along with an interview with Craig Murphy can be read here; http://igloomag.com/profiles/label-extrapolation-piece-part-1 
From 2002 to 2007 Murphy worked on Solipsism material with the American Multi-Instrumentalist Ed Drury, from Portland, Oregon. Drury was a Folk Singer and guitarist from the early 1970s New York “Café Scene”. Some of the original 1970s compositions were resurrected and re-worked for their 2008 release with Neil Carlill as Shoosh titled Orpheum Circuit. The album was inspired by American Cop Shows from the 1970s, 1920s Vaudeville Theatre and Spaghetti Westerns. The Orpheum Circuit was a Vaudeville Theatre Company established in 1919 by Martin Beck in the State of Delaware. Since 2007 Murphy has worked solo on the Solipsism material while continuing to work with Ed Drury on the Shoosh project. As well as his official releases, Solipsism has released material on a number of Compilation Albums. The most notable of which was the “Is This Music?” Magazines’ Cover CD featuring the track “At The Beach”. Is This Music? is a highly-respected and long-running Music Magazine from Scotland covering innovative artists and bands from around the World. Magazine: http://www.isthismusic.com 
Solipsism’s releases, Refract Me, Don’t Subtract Me and It Could Be Clouds were released on the 1st of September 2011 and the 13th of December 2010 respectively via Herb Recordings. With Refract Me, Don't Subtract Me being Solipsism’s first full release to feature heavily-effected, the processed electric guitars. “Solipsism is the nom de guerre of Glasgow’s Herb Recordings label head Craig Murphy. The Herb catalogue has gotten long-term play around Igloo and D:N including the excellent KINGBASTARD mix back in 2009 on Digital:Nimbus Show 351. Their output tends to exactly the strains of experimental electronic that gets our motors moving and this latest excursion from Murphy is no exception.”Read a review of Refract Me, Don’t Subtract Me here:http://igloomag.com/reviews/solipsism-refract-me-dont-subtract-me-herb 
“An adventurous foray into extraterrestrial techno and subsequent experiments in ambient sound design, but don’t let the genre tags skew any pre-conceived notions of Solipsism’s established panoramic modulation.” Read a review of It Could Be Clouds here: http://igloomag.com/reviews/solipsism-it-could-be-clouds-herb 
During the period of late 2011, into early 2012, Solipsism released Let’s Watch The Sunrise on the Ambient label Cathedral Transmissions as a digipak CD, Soliloquy which was a CD only release, went out on the Ambient label Txt Recordings and the Minimal Techno release Habitual Hybrids, was released on the label he runs, Herb Recordings, who release innovative, contemporary music of varying styles.  These albums were the culmination of 2 years work and demonstrate vividly, Murphy’s versatile approach to composition and production.

495329,407536,"The '''Radio Corporation of America''' (est. 1901) did not start producing discs until 1929 when it bought the '''Victor Talking Machine Company''' and changed its name. The '''RCA Victor Company''' had two main divisions; one manufacturing electrical equipment such as radios and televisions, the other devoted to recordings. The recording branch has been known under various names during its history, but was initially called '''RCA Victor'''. The '''RCA Records imprint was not used until the late 1940s.'''
The company released the first 45rpm record in 1949 and was subsequently divided into '''RCA''' (for pop, rock and country music) and '''RCA Victor''' (for blues, world music, and jazz). '''RCA Red Seal''' is the renowned classical music label with a reissue sub-label called '''RCA Gold Seal'''. Defunct labels from the past include budget labels '''RCA Camden''' and '''RCA Victrola'''.
In 1955, RCA Records purchased the recording contract of '''Elvis Presley''' from '''Sun Records'''.
In 1983, 50% of '''Arista Records''' was sold to RCA, and two years later, '''Bertelsmann''' (the owner of the other 50%) and RCA formed a joint venture which led to the creation of '''Bertelsmann Music Group''' (encompassing Arista, Ariola, RCA and Bertelsmann) in 1986.
With the history of RCA in the US, and the distribution power of Bertelsmann in Europe, '''BMG''' was one of the most successful music groups from the mid-80s to 2004, when it joined forces with Japanese conglomerate '''Sony'''.
RCA Records still exists as an imprint for many original releases, with '''Legacy''' issuing much of the RCA back catalogue, all via Sony/BMG's international outposts.

Worldwide distribution network, based on Broadway, NYC. Responsible for national branches of '''RCA Records''' (e.g. US, UK, Australia), along with '''Arista''', '''Jive''', and '''Zomba'''. Is, in fact, a fully-owned subsidiary of '''BMG''', which has been involved in a joint venture with '''Sony''' since August 2004.

As of October 7, 2011, record labels '''Arista''', '''Jive''', and '''J Records''' were shut down and their signed artists moved to a restructured '''RCA Records'''.",,2012-04-22 15:39:56.126994+02

168461,498443,"""Far From Sundown"" formed in late August of 2009. Faced with many different influences, the band had to choose a direction to take with their music. With clashing styles of Alternative Rock and Heavy Metal, the band took modern rock and gave it an exhilarating overhaul. 

While breaking the norm of the 3 chords anthems and refreshing the ideas and concepts of classic rock with some hints of pop/punk and metal influences, they have developed a new style that has its own place among the many genres of music. Place it wherever you want, and call it whatever you may, but the band will take your breath away and replace it with fist full of powerful, passionate music. 

Far From Sundown is: 

Nick Simmons - Vocals, Rhythm Guitar, Keyboard

Andrew Virgilio â€“ Drums

465973,502288,"Solipsism is Craig Murphy, an Experimental Musician and Recording Artist from Glasgow in Scotland. His cross-genre style incorporates elements of Ambient, Techno, IDM, Electro and Experimental Music and his releases have been featured on various Radio Stations from across the Globe, including BBC Radio 1, BBC6 Music, XFM London and Digital Nimbus (U.S.A). 
He is also a member of the Psychedelic/Folk band Shoosh, alongside Ed Drury and Neil Carlill. The latter who had several Top 40 hits in the UK with his band Delicatessen (Rough Trade, Big Life). Shoosh have released music on Awkward Silence Recordings and Herb Recordings. Murphy founded the Independent Record Label Herb Recordings in 2006 and he continues to run it to this day. Herb Recordings is distributed on CD by Cargo Records of London and on Digital Formats by State51 also of London. Previously they have been distributed by Amato and INGrooves. Main Site: http://solipsism.bandcamp.com | http://herbrecordings.bandcamp.com Label Site: http://www.herbrecordings.com Physical Distribution: http://www.cargorecords.co.uk Digital Distribution: http://www.state51.co.uk 
Herb Recordings has released albums globally by many Artists both from the UK and abroad, such as; Kingbastard, Engine7, Skytree, Shoosh, Solipsism, Jack Marchment, Haz, Shamanic Technology and Mosca. The Label was set up by Solipsism as a platform to release music that had the right blend of melody and experimentalism at a time when Electronic Music was being dominated by Producers rather than Musicians. Herb Recordings therefore became a platform for Producers who were also serious Musicians and as such, their output has warmth that’s often lacking in contemporary Electronic Music. 
After Amato Distribution of London went into administration in October 2008, the Label switched both their Physical and Digital operations to Cargo Records. They remain with Cargo Records for Europe-wide CD and Vinyl distribution, but as of February 2011, they have been distributed on Digital Formats by State51. State51 specialises is Experimental, Independent Labels and also distributes the likes of The Leaf Label, Lo Recordings and Twisted Nerve. In 2010 Herb Recordings was nominated as one of the Top Ten Experimental labels by the highly respected Igloo Magazine. The full article along with an interview with Craig Murphy can be read here; http://igloomag.com/profiles/label-extrapolation-piece-part-1 
From 2002 to 2007 Murphy worked on Solipsism material with the American Multi-Instrumentalist Ed Drury, from Portland, Oregon. Drury was a Folk Singer and guitarist from the early 1970s New York “Café Scene”. Some of the original 1970s compositions were resurrected and re-worked for their 2008 release with Neil Carlill as Shoosh titled Orpheum Circuit. The album was inspired by American Cop Shows from the 1970s, 1920s Vaudeville Theatre and Spaghetti Westerns. The Orpheum Circuit was a Vaudeville Theatre Company established in 1919 by Martin Beck in the State of Delaware. Since 2007 Murphy has worked solo on the Solipsism material while continuing to work with Ed Drury on the Shoosh project. As well as his official releases, Solipsism has released material on a number of Compilation Albums. The most notable of which was the “Is This Music?” Magazines’ Cover CD featuring the track “At The Beach”. Is This Music? is a highly-respected and long-running Music Magazine from Scotland covering innovative artists and bands from around the World. Magazine: http://www.isthismusic.com
 Solipsism’s latest releases Refract Me, Don’t Subtract Me and It Could Be Clouds were released on the 1st of September 2011 and the 13th of December 2010 respectively via Herb Recordings.   With Refract Me, Don't Subtract Me being Solipsism’s first full release to feature heavily-effected, the processed electric guitars. “Solipsism is the nom de guerre of Glasgow’s Herb Recordings label head Craig Murphy. The Herb catalogue has gotten long-term play around Igloo and D:N including the excellent KINGBASTARD mix back in 2009 on Digital:Nimbus Show 351. Their output tends to exactly the strains of experimental electronic that gets our motors moving and this latest excursion from Murphy is no exception.”   Read a review of Refract Me, Don’t Subtract Me here:   http://igloomag.com/reviews/solipsism-refract-me-dont-subtract-me-herb

 “An adventurous foray into extraterrestrial techno and subsequent experiments in ambient sound design, but don’t let the genre tags skew any pre-conceived notions of Solipsism’s established panoramic modulation.” Read a review of It Could Be Clouds here: http://igloomag.com/reviews/solipsism-it-could-be-clouds-herb

467096,407536,"== A Brief History ==
One of the 'Big Four' record companies, Sony BMG Music Entertainment was the result of a 50–50 joint venture between [http://www.musicbrainz.org/label/9e6b4d7f-4958-4db7-8504-d89e315836af|Sony Music Entertainment] and [http://www.musicbrainz.org/label/29d7c88f-5200-4418-a683-5c94ea032e38|Bertelsmann Music Group] that was begun on August 5, 2004.  This was the label name for Sony Music and BMG companies worldwide, except for Japan which remains (to this day) [http://www.musicbrainz.org/label/0331bcea-3905-4893-9874-1d3f10480625|Sony Music Entertainment Japan].
 
On October 1, 2008, Sony completed the acquisition of BMG's stake in the company, and the label was once again known as [http://www.musicbrainz.org/label/9e6b4d7f-4958-4db7-8504-d89e315836af|Sony Music Entertainment] (the  imprint used before the 2004 merger).  Releases as of October 1, 2008 should be added to [http://www.musicbrainz.org/label/9e6b4d7f-4958-4db7-8504-d89e315836af|Sony Music Entertainment] and not this label.

== What release to put where? ==
Sony-BMG consisted of 3 main 'frontline' companies, [http://musicbrainz.org/label/011d1192-6f65-45bd-85c4-0400dd45693e.html|Columbia], [http://musicbrainz.org/label/1ca5ed29-e00b-4ea5-b817-0bcca0e04946.html|RCA] and [http://musicbrainz.org/label/8f638ddb-131a-4cc3-b3d4-7ebdac201b55.html|Epic], all of which had its own further subsidiaries (Jive, Syco, Phonogenic etc.).  It is strongly recommended to use the '''lowest subsidiary''' listed on back covers when filing releases.  If no smaller subsidiary than the frontline labels can be found then use one of those.  Sony-BMG was also used as an imprint in its own right (for compilations etc.), which should be the only cases where this label should be used.

No releases should be listed here with a release date prior to August 5, 2004, and releases from October 1, 2008 and later should be checked carefully. In most of these cases, they should be attributed to [http://www.musicbrainz.org/label/9e6b4d7f-4958-4db7-8504-d89e315836af|Sony Music Entertainment].

As Sony did not merge the Japanese branch with BMG, no Japanese releases should be under this label, instead, add them to [http://www.musicbrainz.org/label/0331bcea-3905-4893-9874-1d3f10480625|Sony Music Entertainment Japan].

Please use accurate labels for the release date specified, or leave the label field blank.

Do '''not''' create national branches ('Sony BMG Zambia' etc.) unless you are 100% sure it is a valid imprint.

One of the 'Big Four' record companies, Sony BMG Music Entertainment was the result of a 50–50 joint venture between Sony Music Entertainment and Bertelsmann Music Group that was begun on August 5, 2004.  This was the label name for Sony Music and BMG companies worldwide, except for Japan which remains (to this day) [http://www.musicbrainz.org/label/0331bcea-3905-4893-9874-1d3f10480625|Sony Music Entertainment Japan].
 
On October 1, 2008, Sony completed the acquisition of BMG's stake in the company, and the label was once again known as [http://www.musicbrainz.org/label/9e6b4d7f-4958-4db7-8504-d89e315836af|Sony Music Entertainment] (the  imprint used before the 2004 merger).  Releases as of October 1, 2008 should be added to [http://www.musicbrainz.org/label/9e6b4d7f-4958-4db7-8504-d89e315836af|Sony Music Entertainment] and not this label.

== What release to put where? ==
Sony-BMG consisted of 3 main 'frontline' companies, [http://musicbrainz.org/label/011d1192-6f65-45bd-85c4-0400dd45693e.html|Columbia], [http://musicbrainz.org/label/1ca5ed29-e00b-4ea5-b817-0bcca0e04946.html|RCA] and [http://musicbrainz.org/label/8f638ddb-131a-4cc3-b3d4-7ebdac201b55.html|Epic], all of which had its own further subsidiaries (Jive, Syco, Phonogenic etc.).  It is strongly recommended to use the '''lowest subsidiary''' listed on back covers when filing releases.  If no smaller subsidiary than the frontline labels can be found then use one of those.  Sony-BMG was also used as an imprint in its own right (for compilations etc.), which should be the only cases where this label should be used.

No releases should be listed here with a release date prior to August 5, 2004, and releases from October 1, 2008 and later should be checked carefully. In most of these cases, they should be attributed to [http://www.musicbrainz.org/label/9e6b4d7f-4958-4db7-8504-d89e315836af|Sony Music Entertainment].

As Sony did not merge the Japanese branch with BMG, no Japanese releases should be under this label, instead, add them to [http://www.musicbrainz.org/label/0331bcea-3905-4893-9874-1d3f10480625|Sony Music Entertainment Japan].

Please use accurate labels for the release date specified, or leave the label field blank.

Do '''not''' create national branches ('Sony BMG Zambia' etc.) unless you are 100% sure it is a valid imprint.

494829,407536,"The '''Radio Corporation of America''' (est. 1901) did not start producing discs until 1929 when it bought the '''Victor Talking Machine Company''' and changed its name. The '''RCA Victor Company''' had two main divisions; one manufacturing electrical equipment such as radios and televisions, the other devoted to recordings. The recording branch has been known under various names during its history, but was initially called '''RCA Victor'''. The '''RCA Records imprint was not used until the late 1940s.'''
The company released the first 45rpm record in 1949 and was subsequently divided into '''RCA''' (for pop, rock and country music) and '''RCA Victor''' (for blues, world music, and jazz). '''RCA Red Seal''' is the renowned classical music label with a reissue sub-label called '''RCA Gold Seal'''. Defunct labels from the past include budget labels '''RCA Camden''' and '''RCA Victrola'''.
In 1955, RCA Records purchased the recording contract of '''Elvis Presley''' from '''Sun Records'''.
In 1983, 50% of '''Arista Records''' was sold to RCA, and two years later, '''Bertelsmann''' (the owner of the other 50%) and RCA formed a joint venture which led to the creation of '''Bertelsmann Music Group''' (encompassing Arista, Ariola, RCA and Bertelsmann) in 1986.
With the history of RCA in the US, and the distribution power of Bertelsmann in Europe, '''BMG''' was one of the most successful music groups from the mid-80s to 2004, when it joined forces with Japanese conglomerate '''Sony'''.
RCA Records still exists as an imprint for many original releases, with '''Legacy''' issuing much of the RCA back catalogue, all via Sony/BMG's international outposts.

Worldwide distribution network, based on Broadway, NYC. Responsible for national branches of '''RCA Records''' (e.g. US, UK, Australia), along with '''Arista''', '''Jive''', and '''Zomba'''. Is, in fact, a fully-owned subsidiary of '''BMG''', which has been involved in a joint venture with '''Sony''' since August 2004.

As of October 7, 2011, record labels '''Arista''', '''Jive''', and '''J Records''' were shut down and their signed artists moved to '''RCA Records'''.",,2012-04-17 12:41:23.107107+02

Formed in April of 2011, Roll It Over is a Hard Rock/Alternative band from Baltimore, MD. The group, comprised of musicians who have been playing in Baltimore's local music scene for years, immediately began constructing songs comprised of big chorus's and catchy guitar riffs.

The band played there first show on June 4th, 2011. Though only their first show, the audience was blown away by the live performance put forth by the band. There energy on stage coupled with their strong sonic architecture left many, including Mid-Atlantic Rock Review and Shockwave Magazine, believing that these guys are a force to be reckoned with. The band is currently writing and recording material with the hopes of having an EP out within the next year.

Keep your eyes peeled as Roll It Over invades your ears and leaves you speechless.

The band has shared the stage with many talented acts including: Bang Tango, Kip Winger, and ZO2",,2011-06-18 18:48:36.464243+02

His ever-evolving style has seen him journey through Ambient, Soundtrack, Techno, IDM, Psychedelic, Minimal and Experimental music and his releases have been featured on various radio stations from across the globe including BBC Radio 1, BBC6 Music, XFM London and Digital Nimbus (U.S.A). 
He was also a member of the Psychedelic/Folk band Shoosh, alongside Ed Drury and Neil Carlill. The latter who had several Top 40 hits in the UK with his band Delicatessen (Rough Trade, Big Life). Shoosh have released music on Awkward Silence Recordings and Herb Recordings. Murphy founded the Independent Record Label Herb Recordings in 2006 and he continues to run it to this day.

Herb Recordings have released albums globally by many artists both from the UK and abroad, such as; Kingbastard, Engine7, Skytree, Shoosh, Solipsism, Pumajaw, Jack Marchment, Haz, Shamanic Technology, Mosca, Soulacybin, Vedette and Rat Faced Boy. The Label was set up by Solipsism as a platform to release music that had the right blend of melody and experimentalism at a time when electronic music was being dominated by producers rather than musicians. Herb Recordings therefore became a platform for artists who were serious musicians and as such, their output has warmth that’s often lacking in contemporary electronic music. 
After Amato Distribution of London went into administration in October 2008, the label switched both their Physical and Digital operations to Cargo Records. They remain with Cargo Records for Europe-wide CD and vinyl distribution, but as of February 2011, they have been distributed on digital formats by State51.  State51 specialise in experimental, independent Labels and also distributes the likes of The Leaf Label, Lo Recordings and Twisted Nerve. In 2010 Herb Recordings was nominated as one of the top ten experimental labels by the highly respected Igloo Magazine.

From 2002 to 2007 Murphy worked on Solipsism material with the American Multi-Instrumentalist Ed Drury, from Portland, Oregon. Drury was a folk singer and guitarist from the early 1970s New York “café scene”. Some of the original 1970s compositions were resurrected and re-worked for their 2008 release with Neil Carlill as Shoosh titled Orpheum Circuit. The album was inspired by American cop shows from the 1970s, 1920s vaudeville theatre and spaghetti westerns. The Orpheum Circuit was a vaudeville theatre company established in 1919 by Martin Beck in the State of Delaware. Since 2007 Murphy has worked solo on the Solipsism project. As well as his official releases, Solipsism has released material on a number of compilation albums, the most notable of which was the “Is This Music?” Magazines’ Cover CD featuring the track “At The Beach”. Is This Music? is a highly-respected and long-running Music Magazine from Scotland covering innovative artists and bands from around the World. Magazine: http://www.isthismusic.com/ 
Solipsism’s releases, Refract Me, Don’t Subtract Me and It Could Be Clouds were released on the 1st of September 2011 and the 13th of December 2010 respectively via Herb Recordings. With Refract Me, Don't Subtract Me being Solipsism’s first full release to feature heavily-effected, the processed electric guitars. “Solipsism is the nom de guerre of Glasgow’s Herb Recordings label head Craig Murphy. The Herb catalogue has gotten long-term play around Igloo and D:N including the excellent KINGBASTARD mix back in 2009 on Digital:Nimbus Show 351. Their output tends to exactly the strains of experimental electronic that gets our motors moving and this latest excursion from Murphy is no exception.”Read a review of Refract Me, Don’t Subtract Me here:http://igloomag.com/reviews/solipsism-refract-me-dont-subtract-me-herb 
“An adventurous foray into extraterrestrial techno and subsequent experiments in ambient sound design, but don’t let the genre tags skew any pre-conceived notions of Solipsism’s established panoramic modulation.” Read a review of It Could Be Clouds here:http://igloomag.com/reviews/solipsism-it-could-be-clouds-herb 
During the period of early 2011, into late 2012, Solipsism released Let’s Watch The Sunrise on the Ambient label Cathedral Transmissions as a digipak CD, Soliloquy which was a CD only release, went out on the Ambient label Txt Recordings, the Minimal Techno release Habitual Hybrids and the Ambient Soundtrack album Weaving Spiders were both released on the label he runs, Herb Recordings, who release innovative, contemporary music of varying styles. These albums were the culmination of 3 years work and demonstrate vividly, Murphy’s versatile approach to composition and production.  Philippe Blache of Igloo Magazine says of Weaving Spiders, “Weaving spiders is a magnificent and sonically meditative sound experience, colorfully ritualistic, spherical and deeply absorbing. The music takes advantages to visual-perceptual forms, tonal clusters which activate a discreet dialogue between the subjective memory of the listener and the complex sound environment. No mistake and perfectly achieved emotional based drone release. Absolutely recommended and possibly a timeless release.”  Read the full review here: http://igloomag.com/reviews/solipsism-weaving-spiders-herb

These albums were the culmination of 3 years work and demonstrate vividly, Murphy’s versatile approach to composition and production.

Absolutely recommended and possibly a timeless release.”  Read the full review here: http://igloomag.com/reviews/solipsism-weaving-spiders-herb

Drury was a folk singer and guitarist from the early 1970s New York “café scene”. Some of the original 1970s compositions were resurrected and re-worked for their 2008 release with Neil Carlill as Shoosh titled Orpheum Circuit. The album was inspired by American cop shows from the 1970s, 1920s vaudeville theatre and spaghetti westerns. The Orpheum Circuit was a vaudeville theatre company established in 1919 by Martin Beck in the State of Delaware. Since 2007 Murphy has worked solo on the Solipsism project.

== A Brief History ==
Sony BMG Music Entertainment was the result of a 50–50 joint venture between Sony Music Entertainment and Bertelsmann Music Group.  This was the label name for Sony Music and BMG companies worldwide, expect for Japan which remained (to this day) Sony Music Japan.

In October 2008, Sony completed the acquisition of BMG's stake in the company, and renamed the label back to Sony Music Entertainment (the  imprint used before 2004).  Releases after October 2008 should be added to Sony Music and not this label.

== What release to put where? ==
Sony-BMG consisted of 3 main 'frontline' companies, Columbia, RCA and Epic, which also had its own subsidiaries (Jive, Syco, Phonogenic etc.).  It is strongly recommended to use the lowest subsidiary listed on back covers when filing releases.  If no smaller subsidiary than the frontline labels can be found then use one of those.  Sony-BMG was also used as an imprint in its own right (for compilations etc.), which is where this label should be used.

No releases should be listed here with a release date prior to the start date of August 2004, and releases from October 2008 and later should be checked carefully.

Please use accurate labels for the release date specified, or leave the label field blank.

Do '''not''' create national branches ('Sony BMG Zambia' etc.) unless you are 100% sure it is a valid imprint.

The '''RCA Victor Company''' had two main divisions; one manufacturing electrical equipment such as radios and televisions, the other devoted to recordings. The recording branch has been known under various names during its history, but was initially called '''RCA Victor'''. The '''RCA Records imprint was not used until the late 1940s.'''
The company released the first 45rpm record in 1949 and was subsequently divided into '''RCA''' (for pop, rock and country music) and '''RCA Victor''' (for blues, world music, and jazz). '''RCA Red Seal''' is the renowned classical music label with a reissue sub-label called '''RCA Gold Seal'''. Defunct labels from the past include budget labels '''RCA Camden''' and '''RCA Victrola'''.
In 1955, RCA Records purchased the recording contract of '''Elvis Presley''' from '''Sun Records'''.
In 1983, 50% of '''Arista Records''' was sold to RCA, and two years later, '''Bertelsmann''' (the owner of the other 50%) and RCA formed a joint venture which led to the creation of '''Bertelsmann Music Group''' (encompassing Arista, Ariola, RCA and Bertelsmann) in 1986.
With the history of RCA in the US, and the distribution power of Bertelsmann in Europe, '''BMG''' was one of the most successful music groups from the mid-80s to 2004, when it joined forces with Japanese conglomerate '''Sony'''.

The Label was set up by Solipsism as a platform to release music that had the right blend of melody and experimentalism at a time when Electronic Music was being dominated by Producers rather than Musicians.  Herb Recordings therefore became a platform for Producers who were also serious Musicians and as such, their output has warmth that’s often lacking in contemporary Electronic Music. 

After Amato Distribution of London went into administration in October 2008, the Label switched both their Physical and Digital operations to Cargo Records.  They remain with Cargo Records for Europe-wide CD and Vinyl distribution, but as of February 2011, they have been distributed on Digital Formats by State51.   State51 specialises is Experimental, Independent Labels and also distributes the likes of The Leaf Label, Lo Recordings and Twisted Nerve. 

In 2010 Herb Recordings was nominated as one of the Top Ten Experimental labels by the highly respected Igloo Magazine.

From 2002 to 2007 Murphy worked on Solipsism material with the American Multi-Instrumentalist Ed Drury, from Portland, Oregon.  Drury was a Folk Singer and guitarist from the early 1970s New York “Café Scene”.  Some of the original 1970s compositions were resurrected and re-worked for their 2008 release with Neil Carlill as Shoosh titled Orpheum Circuit.  The album was inspired by American Cop Shows from the 1970s, 1920s Vaudeville Theatre and Spaghetti Westerns.  The Orpheum Circuit was a Vaudeville Theatre Company established in 1919 by Martin Beck in the State of Delaware. 

Since 2007 Murphy has worked solo on the Solipsism material while continuing to work with Ed Drury on the Shoosh project. 


As well as his official releases, Solipsism has released material on a number of Compilation Albums.  The most notable of which was the “Is This Music?” Magazines’ Cover CD featuring the track “At The Beach”.   Is This Music? is a highly-respected and long-running Music Magazine from Scotland covering innovative artists and bands from around the World.

Solipsism’s latest release It Could Be Clouds was released on the 13th of  December 2010 via Herb Recordings.   He is currently working on a new album featuring heavily-effected guitars that will be released later in 2011. 

“An adventurous foray into extraterrestrial techno and subsequent experiments in ambient sound design, but don’t let the genre tags skew any pre-conceived notions of Solipsism’s established panoramic modulation.”
